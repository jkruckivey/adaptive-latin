# First Conjugation Verbs (Present System)

## Introduction: From Nouns to Verbs

In Concept 001, you learned how Latin nouns change their endings to show their function in a sentence. Now we turn to **verbs** - words that express actions or states of being.

You've already met one verb: **sum** (to be), which is irregular. Now you'll learn the **first conjugation** - the most regular and predictable pattern of Latin verbs. Master this pattern, and you'll be able to form hundreds of verbs!

This concept covers the **present system** of first conjugation verbs:
1. **Present tense** - actions happening now
2. **Imperfect tense** - actions that were ongoing or repeated in the past
3. **Future tense** - actions that will happen

---

## Part 1: What is a Conjugation?

### Conjugation vs. Declension

Just as **declension** is a pattern for nouns, **conjugation** is a pattern for verbs.

- **Declension**: Changing noun endings to show case and number
- **Conjugation**: Changing verb endings to show person, number, and tense

Latin has **four regular conjugations** (plus irregular verbs). We'll start with the first - the simplest and most common.

### Identifying First Conjugation Verbs

First conjugation verbs are identified by their **infinitive ending**: **-āre**

**Dictionary Entry Format**: amō, amāre, amāvī, amātum (to love)
- **amō** = 1st person singular present (I love)
- **amāre** = present infinitive (to love) ← This tells you it's 1st conjugation!
- **amāvī** = 1st person singular perfect (I loved/have loved) [you'll learn this in Concept 005]
- **amātum** = supine (used for some compound forms)

**Key Recognition**: If the infinitive ends in **-āre**, it's first conjugation!

### Practice Vocabulary

Memorize these first conjugation verbs:

| 1st Sg. Present | Infinitive | English | Notes |
|-----------------|------------|---------|-------|
| amō | amāre | to love, like | Most common example |
| vocō | vocāre | to call, summon | |
| portō | portāre | to carry, bring | Think "portable" |
| laborō | laborāre | to work, labor | Think "laboratory" |
| narrō | narrāre | to tell, relate | Think "narrate" |
| dō | dare | to give | Irregular (short -a-) |
| stō | stāre | to stand | Think "statue" |

---

## Part 2: The Present Stem

Before conjugating, you need to find the **present stem**.

**Rule**: Drop **-re** from the infinitive.

Examples:
- amā**re** → amā- (stem)
- vocā**re** → vocā- (stem)
- portā**re** → portā- (stem)

This stem is the foundation for all present system tenses (present, imperfect, future).

---

## Part 3: Personal Endings

Latin verbs use **personal endings** to show who is doing the action. These endings are consistent across all three tenses of the present system.

### Active Personal Endings

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **-ō** / **-m** | **-mus** |
| 2nd | **-s** | **-tis** |
| 3rd | **-t** | **-nt** |

**Note**:
- 1st person singular uses **-ō** in present tense, but **-m** in imperfect and future
- These endings tell you WHO (I, you, he/she/it, we, you all, they)
- Latin doesn't need pronouns - the ending tells you!

---

## Part 4: Present Tense

The **present tense** describes actions happening now or habitually.

**Formation**: Present stem + personal endings

### Complete Conjugation: amō (to love)

| Person | Singular | Translation | Plural | Translation |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 1st | am**ō** | I love, I am loving | amā**mus** | we love, we are loving |
| 2nd | amā**s** | you love, you are loving | amā**tis** | you (pl.) love/are loving |
| 3rd | ama**t** | he/she/it loves, is loving | ama**nt** | they love, they are loving |

**Breakdown**:
- amō = amā- (stem) + -ō (1st sg. ending)
- amās = amā- (stem) + -s (2nd sg. ending)
- amat = amā- (stem) + -t (3rd sg. ending)
- And so on...

**Important**: The **-ā-** shortens before **-t** and **-nt** (amat, amant), but stays long elsewhere (amās, amāmus).

### Translation Options

Latin present tense has multiple English translations:

- **amō** = "I love" OR "I am loving" OR "I do love"
- **amat** = "he/she/it loves" OR "is loving" OR "does love"

Choose the translation that sounds most natural in English context.

### Common Verbs - Present Tense Examples

**vocō (to call)**:
- vocō, vocās, vocat, vocāmus, vocātis, vocant

**portō (to carry)**:
- portō, portās, portat, portāmus, portātis, portant

**laborō (to work)**:
- laborō, laborās, laborat, laborāmus, laborātis, laborant

---

## Part 5: Imperfect Tense

The **imperfect tense** describes actions that:
- Were ongoing in the past ("I was loving")
- Were habitual/repeated in the past ("I used to love")
- Were incomplete ("I began to love")

**Formation**: Present stem + **-bā-** (tense sign) + personal endings

**Key marker**: Look for **-ba-** in the verb - this signals imperfect tense!

### Complete Conjugation: amō (to love) - Imperfect

| Person | Singular | Translation | Plural | Translation |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 1st | amāba**m** | I was loving, I used to love | amābā**mus** | we were loving, used to love |
| 2nd | amābā**s** | you were loving, used to love | amābā**tis** | you (pl.) were/used to love |
| 3rd | amāba**t** | he/she/it was loving, used to love | amāba**nt** | they were/used to love |

**Breakdown**:
- amābam = amā- (stem) + -bā- (imperfect sign) + -m (1st sg. ending)
- amābās = amā- (stem) + -bā- (imperfect sign) + -s (2nd sg. ending)
- amābat = amā- (stem) + -bā- (imperfect sign) + -t (3rd sg. ending)

**Notice**:
- The **-bā-** stays long throughout except before **-m** and **-nt** (amābam, amābant)
- 1st person singular uses **-m**, not **-ō**

### Translation Options

- **amābam** = "I was loving" OR "I used to love" OR "I kept loving"
- **amābat** = "he/she/it was loving" OR "used to love" OR "kept loving"

The imperfect emphasizes the **ongoing** or **habitual** nature of past action.

---

## Part 6: Future Tense

The **future tense** describes actions that will happen.

**Formation**: Present stem + **-bi-/-bu-** (tense sign) + personal endings

**Key marker**: Look for **-bi-** or **-bu-** in the verb - this signals future tense!

### Complete Conjugation: amō (to love) - Future

| Person | Singular | Translation | Plural | Translation |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 1st | amā**bō** | I will love, I shall love | amā**bimus** | we will love, we shall love |
| 2nd | amā**bis** | you will love | amā**bitis** | you (pl.) will love |
| 3rd | amā**bit** | he/she/it will love | amā**bunt** | they will love |

**Breakdown**:
- amābō = amā- (stem) + -bō (1st sg. future ending, fused -bi- + -ō)
- amābis = amā- (stem) + -bi- (future sign) + -s (2nd sg. ending)
- amābit = amā- (stem) + -bi- (future sign) + -t (3rd sg. ending)
- amābimus = amā- (stem) + -bi- (future sign) + -mus (1st pl. ending)
- amābitis = amā- (stem) + -bi- (future sign) + -tis (2nd pl. ending)
- amābunt = amā- (stem) + -bu- (variant) + -nt (3rd pl. ending)

**Notice the pattern**:
- 1st person singular: **-bō** (the -bi- fuses with -ō)
- 2nd, 3rd singular, 1st/2nd plural: **-bi-** + ending
- 3rd plural: **-bu-** + -nt (amābunt)

### Translation

- **amābō** = "I will love" OR "I shall love"
- **amābis** = "you will love"
- **amābit** = "he/she/it will love"

Straightforward future meaning in English.

## Part 7: Distinguishing the Three Tenses

### Quick Recognition Guide

| Tense | Marker | Example (amō) | Translation |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Present** | No marker (just stem + ending) | ama**t** | he/she/it loves, is loving |
| **Imperfect** | **-ba-** | amāba**t** | he/she/it was loving, used to love |
| **Future** | **-bi-/-bu-** | amābi**t** | he/she/it will love |

**Comparison - 3rd Person Singular**:
- amat (present) - "loves/is loving"
- amābat (imperfect) - "was loving/used to love"
- amābit (future) - "will love"

**Comparison - 3rd Person Plural**:
- amant (present) - "they love"
- amābant (imperfect) - "they were loving"
- amābunt (future) - "they will love"

**Common Mistake**: Confusing **amant** (present) with **amābunt** (future). Look for the **-bu-** marker!

## Part 9: Combining Verbs with Nouns

Now you can build complete sentences using first conjugation verbs and first declension nouns!

### Sentence Pattern: Subject (nominative) + Object (accusative) + Verb

**Puella aquam portat.**
- Puella (nom. sg.) = the girl (subject)
- aquam (acc. sg.) = water (direct object)
- portat (3rd sg. present) = carries
- Translation: "The girl carries water" OR "The girl is carrying water"

**Puellae viam amābant.**
- Puellae (nom. pl.) = the girls (subject)
- viam (acc. sg.) = the road (direct object)
- amābant (3rd pl. imperfect) = were loving/used to love
- Translation: "The girls used to love the road" OR "The girls were loving the road"

**Puellam vocābō.**
- Puellam (acc. sg.) = the girl (direct object)
- vocābō (1st sg. future) = I will call
- Translation: "I will call the girl"

**Notice**: Word order is still flexible! "Aquam puella portat" means the same thing.

## Part 10: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Confusing Present and Future (3rd Plural)

**Wrong**: Translating "amant" as "they will love"

**Right**:
- amant = they love (present)
- amābunt = they will love (future)

**How to avoid**: Look for the **-bu-** marker in future. Present has no tense marker.

### Mistake 2: Missing the Imperfect Marker

**Wrong**: Translating "amābat" as "he loves"

**Right**: amābat = he was loving / he used to love (imperfect)

**How to avoid**: Always check for **-ba-**, which signals imperfect (ongoing/habitual past).

### Mistake 3: Thinking -re is a Personal Ending

**Wrong**: "The ending -re means... something?"

**Right**: -re is the **infinitive** ending (to love), NOT a personal ending. Drop it to find the stem!

**Infinitive**: amāre = "to love" (not a conjugated form - no person/number)

### Mistake 4: Not Recognizing the Stem

**Wrong**: Trying to conjugate from "amō" instead of finding the stem

**Right**:
1. Start with infinitive: amāre
2. Drop -re: amā-
3. Add endings to stem: amā + s = amās

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Vowel Length Changes

**Issue**: The stem vowel -ā- sometimes shortens.

**Rule**: In present tense, -ā- shortens before -t and -nt:
- amās (long) BUT amat (short)
- amāmus (long) BUT amant (short)

**Why it matters**: Helps with pronunciation and understanding historical forms. But for now, focus on recognizing the pattern.

## Part 11: Translation Practice Strategies

### Strategy 1: Identify the Tense First

1. Look for tense markers:
   - **-ba-** = imperfect
   - **-bi-/-bu-** = future
   - No marker = present

2. Then identify person/number from the ending

**Example**: amābātis
- See **-bā-** → imperfect
- See **-tis** → 2nd person plural
- Translation: "you (all) were loving" or "you used to love"

### Strategy 2: Parse the Sentence

For "Puellae terram amābant":
1. Identify each word:
   - Puellae = nom. pl. (subject) → "the girls"
   - terram = acc. sg. (object) → "the land"
   - amābant = 3rd pl. imperfect → "were loving/used to love"
2. Assemble: "The girls used to love the land"

### Strategy 3: Context Determines English Tense

Latin present can be:
- "loves" (simple present)
- "is loving" (present progressive)
- "does love" (emphatic)

Choose based on English context! "Puella aquam portat" might be "The girl carries water" (habitual) or "The girl is carrying water" (right now).

## Part 12: Quick Reference Charts

### Personal Endings (Active Voice)

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | -ō (pres.) / -m (imp., fut.) | -mus |
| 2nd | -s | -tis |
| 3rd | -t | -nt |

### Tense Formation

| Tense | Formula | Example (amō) |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Present** | stem + ending | amō, amās, amat... |
| **Imperfect** | stem + -bā- + ending | amābam, amābās, amābat... |
| **Future** | stem + -bi-/-bu- + ending | amābō, amābis, amābit... amābunt |

### Recognition Checklist

- Ends in **-āre**? → 1st conjugation infinitive
- Has **-ba-**? → imperfect tense
- Has **-bi-** or **-bu-**? → future tense
- No tense marker? → present tense

## Part 13: Why This Matters

Mastering first conjugation verbs gives you:

1. **Hundreds of verbs**: Most -āre verbs follow this exact pattern
2. **Foundation for other conjugations**: Other conjugations use the same personal endings
3. **Reading ability**: First conjugation verbs are everywhere in Latin texts
4. **Pattern recognition**: Once you internalize this, other conjugations become easier

**Next Steps**: After mastering the present system (present, imperfect, future), you'll learn the **perfect system** (perfect, pluperfect, future perfect) in Concept 005. But master these three tenses first - they're the foundation!
