      "sample_excellent_response": "The present system of Latin verbs includes three tenses: present, imperfect, and future. All three use the same present stem and personal endings, but they differ in their tense markers.\n\nTo form these tenses, first find the present stem by dropping -re from the infinitive. For example, amāre (to love) becomes amā-. Then add the appropriate tense marker and personal endings.\n\nThe present tense has no tense marker - just add personal endings directly to the stem: amō (I love), amās (you love), amat (he/she/it loves), etc. This describes action happening now or habitually.\n\nThe imperfect tense uses -bā- as a tense marker, placed between the stem and the ending: amābam (I was loving), amābās (you were loving), amābat (he/she/it was loving). This describes ongoing or repeated action in the past. Think 'I was loving' or 'I used to love.'\n\nThe future tense uses -bi- or -bu- as a tense marker: amābō (I will love), amābis (you will love), amābit (he/she/it will love), amābunt (they will love). The -bu- variant appears with the -nt ending (3rd plural). This describes action that will happen.\n\nTo recognize these tenses: if you see -ba- in the verb, it's imperfect; if you see -bi- or -bu-, it's future; if there's no tense marker, it's present. For example, portat (carries), portābat (was carrying), portābit (will carry) show all three tenses of the same verb, differing only in their tense markers."
