# Third Declension Nouns (Consonant Stems)

## Introduction: A New Declension Pattern

So far, you've learned two declension patterns:
- **First declension**: puella, puellae (mostly feminine, ending in -a)
- **Second declension**: amīcus, amīcī (masculine -us/-er) and bellum, bellī (neuter -um)

Now you're ready for the **third declension** - the largest and most diverse noun family in Latin. Third declension nouns don't have a predictable nominative singular ending like -a or -us. Instead, you identify them by their **genitive singular ending: -is**.

This declension is more challenging because:
1. You **cannot predict** the nominative from the genitive
2. The **stem** comes from the genitive, not the nominative
3. There are both **consonant stems** (this concept) and i-stems (later)
4. Gender must be learned from the dictionary

But don't worry - once you understand the system, third declension nouns follow predictable patterns just like first and second declension.

## Part 1: Identifying Third Declension Nouns

### The Dictionary Entry Format

Third declension nouns appear in the dictionary like this:

**rēx, rēgis, m.** (king)
- rēx = nominative singular (what form you'll see as the subject)
- rēgis = genitive singular (the form showing "of the king")
- m. = masculine gender
- (king) = English meaning

**Important**: You **must memorize both** nominative and genitive forms because you cannot predict one from the other.

### Why You Need Both Forms

Look at these examples:

| Nominative | Genitive | Stem | Meaning |
|------------|----------|------|---------|
| rēx | rēg**is** | rēg- | king |
| mīles | mīlit**is** | mīlit- | soldier |
| pater | patr**is** | patr- | father |
| virtūs | virtūt**is** | virtūt- | virtue |
| corpus | corpor**is** | corpor- | body |

Notice:
- The nominative forms are completely different: rēx, mīles, pater, virtūs, corpus
- But they all share the genitive ending **-is**
- The **stem** (what you add endings to) comes from the genitive, not the nominative

**Rule**: To find the stem of any third declension noun, drop the **-is** from the genitive singular.

### Finding the Stem

**Step 1**: Look at the genitive singular
**Step 2**: Drop the -is ending
**Step 3**: What's left is your stem

Examples:
- rēg**is** → drop -is → stem is **rēg-**
- mīlit**is** → drop -is → stem is **mīlit-**
- patr**is** → drop -is → stem is **patr-**
- virtūt**is** → drop -is → stem is **virtūt-**
- nōmin**is** → drop -is → stem is **nōmin-**

Once you have the stem, you add third declension endings to it.

## Part 2: Third Declension Masculine/Feminine Paradigm

Masculine and feminine third declension nouns share the same endings. Let's use **rēx, rēgis, m.** (king) as our model.

### Complete Paradigm: rēx, rēgis (king)

| Case | Singular | How Formed | Plural | How Formed |
|------|----------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Nominative** | rēx | (unpredictable) | rēg**ēs** | stem + -ēs |
| **Genitive** | rēg**is** | stem + -is | rēg**um** | stem + -um |
| **Dative** | rēg**ī** | stem + -ī | rēg**ibus** | stem + -ibus |
| **Accusative** | rēg**em** | stem + -em | rēg**ēs** | stem + -ēs |
| **Ablative** | rēg**e** | stem + -e | rēg**ibus** | stem + -ibus |

### Key Observations

**Nominative Singular is Unpredictable**:
- rēx (king), mīles (soldier), pater (father), virtūs (virtue)
- These look completely different from each other
- You must memorize the nominative separately

**Nominative and Accusative Plural are Identical**:
- Both end in **-ēs**: rēgēs can be "the kings" (subject) or "the kings" (object)
- Context tells you which

**Dative and Ablative Plural are Identical**:
- Both end in **-ibus**: rēgibus = "to/for the kings" OR "by/with/from the kings"
- Context determines the case

**The Stem Rules Everything**:
- Forget the nominative singular when declining
- Start with the genitive, find the stem, add endings
- rēgis → rēg- → rēgem, rēgī, rēge, etc.

### More Examples: Masculine/Feminine

**mīles, mīlitis, m.** (soldier)

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nom. | mīles | mīlit**ēs** |
| Gen. | mīlit**is** | mīlit**um** |
| Dat. | mīlit**ī** | mīlit**ibus** |
| Acc. | mīlit**em** | mīlit**ēs** |
| Abl. | mīlit**e** | mīlit**ibus** |

**virtūs, virtūtis, f.** (virtue, courage)

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nom. | virtūs | virtūt**ēs** |
| Gen. | virtūt**is** | virtūt**um** |
| Dat. | virtūt**ī** | virtūt**ibus** |
| Acc. | virtūt**em** | virtūt**ēs** |
| Abl. | virtūt**e** | virtūt**ibus** |

**Gender Assignment**: Third declension nouns can be masculine or feminine. You **cannot guess** gender from the endings - you must learn it from the dictionary.

---

## Part 3: Third Declension Neuter Paradigm

Neuter third declension nouns follow the **neuter rule** you learned in Concept 003:
- **Nominative = Accusative** in both singular and plural
- Nominative/Accusative plural ends in **-a** (not -ēs like M/F)

### Complete Paradigm: nōmen, nōminis (name)

| Case | Singular | How Formed | Plural | How Formed |
|------|----------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Nominative** | nōmen | (unpredictable) | nōmin**a** | stem + -a |
| **Genitive** | nōmin**is** | stem + -is | nōmin**um** | stem + -um |
| **Dative** | nōmin**ī** | stem + -ī | nōmin**ibus** | stem + -ibus |
| **Accusative** | nōmen | same as nom. | nōmin**a** | stem + -a |
| **Ablative** | nōmin**e** | stem + -e | nōmin**ibus** | stem + -ibus |

### Neuter Pattern Summary

**Nominative/Accusative Singular**:
- Unpredictable, must be memorized
- Often ends in -us, -en, -e, or other patterns
- nōmen, corpus, tempus

**Nominative/Accusative Plural**:
- Always **-a** (never -ēs)
- nōmina, corpora, tempora

**All Other Cases**:
- Same as masculine/feminine third declension
- Use the stem from the genitive

### More Neuter Examples

**corpus, corporis, n.** (body)

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nom. | corpus | corpor**a** |
| Gen. | corpor**is** | corpor**um** |
| Dat. | corpor**ī** | corpor**ibus** |
| Acc. | corpus | corpor**a** |
| Abl. | corpor**e** | corpor**ibus** |

**tempus, temporis, n.** (time)

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nom. | tempus | tempor**a** |
| Gen. | tempor**is** | tempor**um** |
| Dat. | tempor**ī** | tempor**ibus** |
| Acc. | tempus | tempor**a** |
| Abl. | tempor**e** | tempor**ibus** |

## Part 4: Why Is the Nominative Unpredictable?

This is one of the most challenging aspects of third declension. Unlike first declension (always -a) or second declension (always -us/-er/-um), third declension nominatives vary wildly:

- **rēx** (king) - ends in -x
- **mīles** (soldier) - ends in -es
- **pater** (father) - ends in -er
- **virtūs** (virtue) - ends in -ūs
- **nōmen** (name) - ends in -en
- **corpus** (body) - ends in -us
- **pāx** (peace) - ends in -x

### Historical Explanation (Optional)

The reason is historical: the nominative singular underwent sound changes in Latin's evolution that altered the original endings. The genitive (and other cases) preserve the older stem more faithfully. Think of the nominative as a "corrupted" form that changed over time, while the genitive shows you the "true" stem.

**For learners**: Don't try to predict. Just memorize the nominative-genitive pair as a unit.

## Part 5: Gender in Third Declension

Unlike first declension (mostly feminine) and second declension (masculine -us/-er, neuter -um), third declension has **all three genders** mixed together.

### How to Know Gender

**Always check the dictionary entry**:
- rēx, rēgis, **m.** → masculine
- virtūs, virtūtis, **f.** → feminine
- corpus, corporis, **n.** → neuter

### Gender Patterns (Helpful but NOT Absolute)

**Tend to be Masculine**:
- Nouns ending in -or (amor "love")
- Nouns ending in -ēs (mīles "soldier")

**Tend to be Feminine**:
- Nouns ending in -tās/-tūs (virtūs "virtue")
- Nouns ending in -tiō (nātiō "nation")
- Nouns ending in -x (pāx "peace")

**Tend to be Neuter**:
- Nouns ending in -us (corpus "body", tempus "time")
- Nouns ending in -en (nōmen "name")
- Nouns ending in -e, -al, -ar

**Warning**: These are tendencies, not rules. Always verify with the dictionary.

## Part 6: Mixing All Three Declensions

Now that you know three declensions, you'll encounter sentences with mixed noun types:

**Rēx puellam vocat.** (The king calls the girl.)
- rēx (3rd decl., nom. sg.) = subject
- puellam (1st decl., acc. sg.) = direct object
- vocat = he calls

**Mīlitēs bella amīcōrum nārrant.** (The soldiers tell about the wars of friends.)
- mīlitēs (3rd decl., nom. pl.) = subject
- bella (2nd decl. neuter, acc. pl.) = direct object
- amīcōrum (2nd decl., gen. pl.) = possession
- nārrant = they tell

**Virtūtem rēgis videō.** (I see the virtue of the king.)
- virtūtem (3rd decl., acc. sg.) = direct object
- rēgis (3rd decl., gen. sg.) = possession
- videō = I see

### Strategy for Mixed Sentences

1. **Identify each noun's declension** by its ending
2. **Find the stem** (for 3rd declension, use genitive)
3. **Determine case** by the ending
4. **Translate** based on case function

## Part 7: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Trying to Predict Nominative from Genitive

**Wrong thinking**: "rēgis has stem rēg-, so nominative must be rēga or rēgus"

**Reality**: The nominative is **rēx** - completely unpredictable from the genitive.

**Solution**: Always memorize the nominative-genitive pair together.

### Mistake 2: Using Nominative Instead of Stem

**Wrong**: "I need dative of rēx, so rēxī"

**Right**: Stem is rēg- (from rēgis), so dative is rēgī

**Solution**: Find stem from genitive (drop -is), then add endings to that stem.

### Mistake 3: Confusing Masculine/Feminine with Neuter Plurals

**Wrong**: "nōmina must be accusative plural because it ends in -a like first declension"

**Right**: nōmina is nominative/accusative plural of nōmen (neuter 3rd decl.)

**Solution**: Neuter plural always ends in -a (nom/acc), regardless of declension.

### Mistake 4: Assuming Gender from Appearance

**Wrong**: "corpus ends in -us like amīcus, so it must be masculine"

**Right**: corpus is **neuter** (corpus, corporis, n.)

**Solution**: Always check the dictionary entry for gender.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Identical Forms

Third declension has several identical forms:
- Nom. pl. = Acc. pl. (both -ēs for M/F, both -a for N)
- Dat. pl. = Abl. pl. (both -ibus)

**Solution**: Use context (verb agreement, prepositions, sentence logic) to determine which case.

## Part 8: Practice Vocabulary

Memorize these third declension nouns with **both nominative and genitive**:

### Masculine
| Nominative | Genitive | Gender | English |
|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| rēx | rēgis | m. | king |
| mīles | mīlitis | m. | soldier |
| pater | patris | m. | father |
| dux | ducis | m. | leader |
| homō | hominis | m. | human, man |

### Feminine
| Nominative | Genitive | Gender | English |
|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| māter | mātris | f. | mother |
| virtūs | virtūtis | f. | virtue, courage |
| pāx | pācis | f. | peace |
| mors | mortis | f. | death |
| lēx | lēgis | f. | law |

### Neuter
| Nominative | Genitive | Gender | English |
|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| nōmen | nōminis | n. | name |
| corpus | corporis | n. | body |
| tempus | temporis | n. | time |
| opus | operis | n. | work |
| genus | generis | n. | race, kind |

## Part 9: Step-by-Step Declension Guide

Let's practice declining a complete noun: **pāx, pācis, f.** (peace)

**Step 1**: What's the genitive singular?
- pācis

**Step 2**: Find the stem by dropping -is
- pāc**is** → drop -is → stem is **pāc-**

**Step 3**: Apply third declension endings to the stem

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nom. | pāx (irregular nom.) | pāc**ēs** (stem + -ēs) |
| Gen. | pāc**is** (stem + -is) | pāc**um** (stem + -um) |
| Dat. | pāc**ī** (stem + -ī) | pāc**ibus** (stem + -ibus) |
| Acc. | pāc**em** (stem + -em) | pāc**ēs** (stem + -ēs) |
| Abl. | pāc**e** (stem + -e) | pāc**ibus** (stem + -ibus) |

**Step 4**: Remember the irregular nominative
- The nominative singular **pāx** doesn't follow a pattern - it's just memorized

**Step 5**: Check gender for adjective agreement (when you learn 3rd decl. adjectives)
- pāx is **feminine**, so any adjective must agree in gender

## Quick Reference: Third Declension Endings

### Masculine/Feminine Endings

```
SINGULAR        PLURAL
--(nom varies)  -ēs (nom)
-is (gen)       -um (gen)
-ī (dat)        -ibus (dat)
-em (acc)       -ēs (acc)
-e (abl)        -ibus (abl)
```

### Neuter Endings

```
SINGULAR        PLURAL
--(nom varies)  -a (nom)
-is (gen)       -um (gen)
-ī (dat)        -ibus (dat)
--(acc varies)  -a (acc)
-e (abl)        -ibus (abl)
```

**Key**: Neuter follows neuter rule (nom = acc), with plural in -a.

---

## Summary

You now know:

✓ Third declension nouns are identified by genitive singular ending **-is**

✓ The **stem** comes from the genitive (drop -is), not the nominative

✓ You **cannot predict** the nominative from the genitive - both must be memorized

✓ Masculine and feminine share the same endings: -is, -ī, -em, -e, -ēs, -um, -ibus

✓ Neuter follows the neuter rule: nom = acc (singular varies, plural -a)

✓ Gender is assigned arbitrarily - always check the dictionary

✓ Third declension mixes with first and second declension in sentences

**Next Steps**: Practice declining nouns, identifying stems, and translating sentences with mixed declensions. The third declension takes time to master, but with practice, the patterns become automatic!

## Study Tips

1. **Make flashcards** with nominative on one side, genitive-gender-meaning on the other
   - Front: rēx
   - Back: rēgis, m., king

2. **Practice finding stems** quickly
   - mīlitis → mīlit-
   - virtūtis → virtūt-
   - corporis → corpor-

3. **Decline one noun completely** each day until automatic

4. **Translate mixed sentences** to practice recognizing all three declensions together

5. **Don't panic** about the unpredictable nominative - with exposure, you'll recognize common patterns
