      "sample_excellent_response": "Third declension is different from first and second declension in several important ways. First, while first declension nouns are identified by their -a nominative ending and second declension by -us/-er (masculine) or -um (neuter), third declension nouns are identified by their genitive singular ending: -is. The nominative singular can end in many different ways (-x, -s, -er, -us, etc.), so you can't rely on it to identify the declension.\n\nThis brings us to the second major difference: you must memorize both the nominative and genitive forms together because you cannot predict one from the other. For example, the noun 'king' is rēx in the nominative, but its genitive is rēgis - you could never guess rēx from rēgis or vice versa. This is because the nominative underwent historical sound changes while the genitive preserved the original stem.\n\nThe stem is crucial for declining third declension nouns. To find it, you take the genitive singular and drop the -is ending. Using our example: rēgis → drop -is → stem is rēg-. Then you add third declension endings to this stem: rēgī (dative), rēgem (accusative), rēge (ablative), rēgēs (nom/acc plural), and so on. Never use the nominative rēx to find the stem - it won't work!\n\nThe key to mastering third declension is accepting that the nominative is unpredictable, always finding your stem from the genitive, and practicing until the paradigm becomes automatic. It's more complex than first and second declension, but once you understand the system, it follows consistent patterns."
