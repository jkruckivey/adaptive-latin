      "sample_excellent_response": "Indirect statement is one of the most challenging Latin constructions, but understanding it opens up so much Latin literature. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the basics: DIRECT statement is when you quote someone's exact words (like 'She said, \"The girl is good\"'), while INDIRECT statement reports what someone said without quoting directly (like 'She said THAT the girl is good'). Notice the word 'that' in English? Latin doesn't use a 'that' word - instead, it uses a special construction called accusative + infinitive.\n\nHere's the key that trips everyone up: when you create indirect statement in Latin, the SUBJECT of what's being said goes into the ACCUSATIVE case, and the verb becomes an INFINITIVE. For example:\n\nDirect: 'Puella bona est.' (The girl is good.) - puella is nominative (subject), est is the verb\nIndirect: 'Dīcō puellam bonam esse.' (I say that the girl is good.) - puellam is accusative, esse is infinitive\n\nWhy accusative? This confuses people because we're used to accusative meaning 'direct object.' But puellam is NOT the object of dīcō - you can't 'say a girl'! Instead, puellam is the SUBJECT of the infinitive esse. In Latin, subjects of infinitives always use accusative case. The whole statement 'puellam bonam esse' is what you're saying.\n\nNow for tense: infinitive tense is RELATIVE to the main verb, not absolute. A present infinitive (like esse) means 'at the same time as the main verb.' So 'Dīcit puellam esse bonam' = 'He says (now) that the girl IS good (now)' - both present. But 'Dīxit puellam esse bonam' = 'He said (then) that the girl WAS good (then)' - both past. Same infinitive (esse), different translation!\n\nPerfect infinitive (like fuisse) means 'before the main verb.' So 'Dīcit puellam fuisse bonam' = 'He says (now) that the girl WAS good (earlier).' The being-good happened before the saying.\n\nHere's another example to cement this:\nDirect: 'Mīlitēs pugnāvērunt.' (The soldiers fought.)\nIndirect: 'Narrō mīlitēs pugnāvisse.' (I tell that the soldiers fought.)\n- mīlitēs became accusative (subject of infinitive)\n- pugnāvērunt became pugnāvisse (perfect infinitive)\n- Perfect infinitive shows the fighting happened before the telling\n\nThe key to mastering this: always ask yourself, 'Who's doing the action of the infinitive?' That's your accusative subject. And 'When does the infinitive's action happen relative to the main verb?' That determines your tense choice. Practice transforming sentences from direct to indirect, and it will click!"
