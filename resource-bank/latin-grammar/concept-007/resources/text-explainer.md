# Infinitives + Indirect Statement (Accusative + Infinitive)

## Welcome to the Capstone Concept!

Congratulations on making it to Concept 007 - the most sophisticated grammatical construction in this sequence. You've mastered noun declensions, verb conjugations, adjective agreement, and complex tense systems. Now you'll learn how Latin expresses what people say, think, believe, and perceive - a construction called **indirect statement** that uses the **accusative + infinitive** pattern.

This concept is challenging because it combines everything you've learned:
- **Case understanding** (accusative as subject, not object!)
- **Verb knowledge** (infinitives are verb forms)
- **Tense relationships** (infinitive tense is relative to the main verb)
- **Syntactic awareness** (recognizing embedded clauses)

Take your time with this material. It's complex, but mastering it unlocks your ability to read authentic Latin literature.

## Part 1: Understanding Infinitives

### What is an Infinitive?

An **infinitive** is a verbal noun - a verb form that functions like a noun. In English, infinitives are marked with "to": to love, to see, to be.

**English examples**:
- "To err is human" (infinitive as subject)
- "I want **to learn** Latin" (infinitive as object)

**Latin infinitives** work similarly but have more forms than English:
- **Present infinitives**: amāre (to love), vidēre (to see), esse (to be)
- **Perfect infinitives**: amāvisse (to have loved), vīdisse (to have seen), fuisse (to have been)
- **Future infinitives**: amātūrus esse (to be about to love), vīsūrus esse (to be about to see), futūrus esse (to be about to be)

Each infinitive also has **active** and **passive** forms (though we'll focus on active for this introduction).

## Part 2: Forming Infinitives

### Present Active Infinitives

The present active infinitive is the second principal part of every Latin verb - the form you've been seeing in vocabulary lists!

**Formation Pattern by Conjugation**:

| Conjugation | Principal Parts Example | Present Infinitive | Meaning |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| First | amō, amāre | am**āre** | to love |
| Second | videō, vidēre | vid**ēre** | to see |
| Third | regō, regere | reg**ere** | to rule |
| Third -iō | capiō, capere | cap**ere** | to take |
| Fourth | audiō, audīre | aud**īre** | to hear |
| Irregular | sum, esse | **esse** | to be |

**Key Pattern**: For regular verbs, drop the -ō from the first principal part and use the second principal part.

### Perfect Active Infinitives

The perfect infinitive expresses completed action ("to have done").

**Formation**: Perfect stem (3rd principal part minus -ī) + **-isse**

**Examples**:
- amō, amāre, amāv**ī** → amāv**isse** (to have loved)
- videō, vidēre, vīd**ī** → vīd**isse** (to have seen)
- sum, esse, fu**ī** → fu**isse** (to have been)
- dīcō, dīcere, dīx**ī** → dīx**isse** (to have said)

**Memory tip**: Think "isse" = "I said something earlier" (perfect/past)

### Future Active Infinitives

The future infinitive expresses future action ("to be about to do").

**Formation**: Future active participle + esse

**Examples**:
- amātūrus esse (to be about to love)
- vīsūrus esse (to be about to see)
- futūrus esse (to be about to be)
- dictūrus esse (to be about to say)

**Note**: The future participle agrees with the subject in gender, number, and case (you'll learn participles later - for now, memorize the -ūrus esse pattern for masculine singular).

**For this concept, focus on present and perfect infinitives** - they're the most common in indirect statement.

## Part 3: Verbs That Introduce Indirect Statement

Not all verbs can introduce indirect statement. **Only verbs of head, heart, and speech** take the accusative + infinitive construction.

### Three Categories

#### 1. Verbs of Saying (Speech)
These verbs express communication:
- **dīcō, dīcere** - to say, tell
- **narrō, narrāre** - to tell, relate, narrate
- **negō, negāre** - to deny, say...not
- **nūntiō, nūntiāre** - to announce, report
- **respondēō, respondēre** - to respond, answer
- **affirmō, affirmāre** - to affirm, assert

#### 2. Verbs of Thinking (Head)
These verbs express mental processes:
- **putō, putāre** - to think, consider
- **crēdō, crēdere** - to believe, trust
- **intellegō, intellegere** - to understand, realize
- **sciō, scīre** - to know
- **spērō, spērāre** - to hope
- **cōgitō, cōgitāre** - to think, ponder

#### 3. Verbs of Perceiving (Heart/Senses)
These verbs express perception:
- **videō, vidēre** - to see (also "to seem" with indirect statement)
- **audiō, audīre** - to hear
- **sentiō, sentīre** - to feel, perceive, sense
- **cognōscō, cognōscere** - to learn, recognize

**Key Insight**: If you can say "I [verb] THAT..." in English, the Latin verb likely takes indirect statement.

**Test it**:
- "I say THAT..." → dīcō + ind. statement
- "I think THAT..." → putō + ind. statement
- "I hear THAT..." → audiō + ind. statement

## Part 4: The Accusative + Infinitive Construction

### What is Indirect Statement?

**Direct statement** reports what someone says using their exact words (like a quotation).

**Indirect statement** reports what someone says without quoting them directly.

**English examples**:
- **Direct**: She said, "The girl is good."
- **Indirect**: She said **that the girl is good**.

Notice the word "that" in English indirect statement? **Latin doesn't use "that"** - instead, it uses a special construction.

### The Latin Pattern: Accusative Subject + Infinitive

When a verb of saying/thinking/perceiving introduces indirect statement in Latin, the subject of what is said/thought/perceived goes into the **accusative case**, and the verb becomes an **infinitive**.

**Basic Formula**:
[Main Verb] + [Subject in Accusative] + [Infinitive]

**Example Transformation**:

**Direct Statement** (what she actually said):
"Puella bona est." (The girl is good.)
- puella = nominative (subject)
- est = finite verb

**Indirect Statement** (reporting what she said):
"Dīcit puellam bonam esse." (She says that the girl is good.)
- Dīcit = main verb (she says)
- puellam = accusative (subject of indirect statement!)
- bonam = accusative (agreeing with puellam)
- esse = infinitive (the "verb" of the indirect statement)

### Why is the Subject Accusative?

This is the hardest concept for English speakers: **puellam is NOT the direct object of dīcit**.

Think of it this way:
- The direct object of "dīcit" is the entire statement "puellam bonam esse" (she says [this whole thing])
- Within that statement, "puellam" is the subject of "esse"
- Latin marks the subject of an infinitive with the **accusative case**

**Common Student Error**:
"Dīcit puellam bonam esse" does NOT mean "She says the girl good to be" (word salad)

**Correct Understanding**:
"Dīcit" = she says
"puellam bonam esse" = that the girl is good (entire indirect statement)

---

## Part 5: Tense of the Infinitive (Relative Time)

This is crucial: **the tense of the infinitive is RELATIVE to the main verb**, not absolute.

### The Three Relationships

| Infinitive Type | Meaning | Relationship to Main Verb |
|----------------|---------|--------------------------|
| **Present infinitive** | "to be [doing]" | **Same time** as main verb |
| **Perfect infinitive** | "to have [done]" | **Before** main verb (prior action) |
| **Future infinitive** | "to be about to [do]" | **After** main verb (later action) |

### Examples with Time Relationships

#### Present Infinitive = Same Time

**Latin**: Dīcit puellam esse bonam.
**Literal**: He says the girl to be good.
**English**: He says that the girl **is** good.
**Analysis**: The girl "being good" happens at the **same time** as he says it (both present).

**Latin**: Dīxit puellam esse bonam.
**Literal**: He said the girl to be good.
**English**: He said that the girl **was** good.
**Analysis**: The girl "being good" happened at the **same time** as he said it (both past).

Notice: the **same present infinitive** (esse) translates as "is" or "was" depending on the main verb's tense!

#### Perfect Infinitive = Before Main Verb

**Latin**: Dīcit puellam fuisse bonam.
**Literal**: He says the girl to have been good.
**English**: He says that the girl **was** good (earlier).
**Analysis**: The girl's "being good" happened **before** he says it now.

**Latin**: Dīxit puellam fuisse bonam.
**Literal**: He said the girl to have been good.
**English**: He said that the girl **had been** good.
**Analysis**: The girl's "being good" happened **before** he said it (past before past = pluperfect).

#### Future Infinitive = After Main Verb

**Latin**: Dīcit puellam futūram esse bonam.
**Literal**: He says the girl to be about to be good.
**English**: He says that the girl **will be** good.
**Analysis**: The girl's "being good" will happen **after** he says it.

**Latin**: Dīxit puellam futūram esse bonam.
**Literal**: He said the girl to be about to be good.
**English**: He said that the girl **would be** good.
**Analysis**: The girl's "being good" would happen **after** he said it (future from past perspective).

### Summary Chart: Infinitive Tense Translations

| Main Verb | Infinitive | Time Relation | English Translation |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Present (dīcit) | Present (esse) | Same time | "says that [she] **is**" |
| Present (dīcit) | Perfect (fuisse) | Before | "says that [she] **was**" |
| Present (dīcit) | Future (futūram esse) | After | "says that [she] **will be**" |
| Past (dīxit) | Present (esse) | Same time | "said that [she] **was**" |
| Past (dīxit) | Perfect (fuisse) | Before | "said that [she] **had been**" |
| Past (dīxit) | Future (futūram esse) | After | "said that [she] **would be**" |

**Key Insight**: You must consider BOTH the main verb's tense AND the infinitive's type to translate correctly.

## Part 6: Working Through Complex Examples

### Example 1: Basic Indirect Statement

**Direct Statement**: "Rex est bonus." (The king is good.)

**Indirect Statement**: "Putō regem esse bonum." (I think that the king is good.)

**Analysis**:
- Putō = I think (main verb, 1st person present)
- regem = accusative singular (subject of infinitive, from rex, regis)
- esse = present infinitive (to be)
- bonum = accusative singular neuter (agreeing with regem)
- Time: Present infinitive with present main verb = same time ("is")

### Example 2: Perfect Infinitive (Prior Time)

**Direct Statement**: "Mīlitēs pugnāvērunt." (The soldiers fought.)

**Indirect Statement**: "Narrō mīlitēs pugnāvisse." (I tell that the soldiers fought / I tell that the soldiers have fought.)

**Analysis**:
- Narrō = I tell (main verb, 1st person present)
- mīlitēs = accusative plural (subject of infinitive, from mīles, mīlitis)
- pugnāvisse = perfect infinitive of pugnō (to have fought)
- Time: Perfect infinitive with present main verb = before now ("fought" or "have fought")

### Example 3: With Past Main Verb

**Indirect Statement**: "Audīvī puellās in silvā esse." (I heard that the girls were in the forest.)

**Analysis**:
- Audīvī = I heard (main verb, 1st person perfect)
- puellās = accusative plural (subject of infinitive)
- in silvā = in the forest (ablative of place where)
- esse = present infinitive (to be)
- Time: Present infinitive with past main verb = same time as the hearing (were)

### Example 4: Embedded with Genitive

**Indirect Statement**: "Crēdō vitam puellārum esse bonam." (I believe that the girls' life is good / I believe that the life of the girls is good.)

**Analysis**:
- Crēdō = I believe (main verb)
- vitam = accusative singular (subject of infinitive - "life" is the thing that is good)
- puellārum = genitive plural (possession - whose life?)
- esse = present infinitive (to be)
- bonam = accusative singular (agreeing with vitam)
- This tests whether students can distinguish the accusative subject (vitam) from the genitive modifier (puellārum)

### Example 5: Negative Indirect Statement

**Direct Statement**: "Puella non est bona." (The girl is not good.)

**Indirect Statement**: "Dīcit puellam bonam nōn esse." (He says that the girl is not good.)

**Analysis**:
- Dīcit = he says (main verb)
- puellam = accusative (subject of infinitive)
- bonam = accusative (agreeing with puellam)
- nōn = not
- esse = present infinitive
- Notice: nōn typically comes before the infinitive in indirect statement

## Part 7: Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Treating the Accusative as Direct Object

**Incorrect Thinking**: "Dīcō puellam" = "I say the girl"

**Why Wrong**: You can't "say" a person - you say something ABOUT a person. The entire accusative + infinitive construction is what you're saying.

**Correct Thinking**: "Dīcō puellam esse bonam" = "I say [the whole statement that] the girl is good"

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Adjective Agreement

**Incorrect**: Dīcō puellam bonus esse. (X)

**Why Wrong**: "Bonus" is nominative/accusative masculine. But "puellam" is accusative feminine, so the adjective must match.

**Correct**: Dīcō puellam bonam esse. (✓)

**Rule**: Adjectives in indirect statement agree with the accusative subject in gender, number, AND case.

### Mistake 3: Wrong Infinitive Tense

**Sentence**: "Dīcit mīlitēs pugnāvisse."

**Incorrect Translation**: "He says that the soldiers are fighting." (X)

**Why Wrong**: Pugnāvisse is the PERFECT infinitive (to have fought), not present.

**Correct Translation**: "He says that the soldiers fought." (✓) or "He says that the soldiers have fought." (✓)

**Rule**: Perfect infinitive = action before the main verb.

### Mistake 4: Adding "that" in Latin

**Incorrect**: Dīcō quod puella bona est. (X - this is a different construction!)

**Why Wrong**: Latin indirect statement doesn't use "quod" (that). The accusative + infinitive construction itself signals indirect statement.

**Correct**: Dīcō puellam bonam esse. (✓)

**Rule**: No "that" word - just accusative subject + infinitive.

### Mistake 5: Confusing Indirect Statement with Indirect Command

**Indirect Statement** (acc + inf): "Dīcō puellam esse bonam" = I say that the girl is good

**Indirect Command** (ut + subjunctive): "Imperō ut puella veniat" = I order that the girl come / I order the girl to come

**Key Difference**:
- Indirect statement reports what IS/WAS/WILL BE (statement of fact or belief)
- Indirect command expresses what should HAPPEN (command, request, wish)

You'll learn indirect command later - for now, remember that verbs of saying/thinking/perceiving take accusative + infinitive for statements.

## Part 8: Strategy for Translating Indirect Statement

Follow these steps every time:

### Step 1: Identify the Main Verb
Look for a verb of saying/thinking/perceiving. This signals indirect statement.

Example: "Putō..." (I think...)

### Step 2: Find the Accusative Subject
Look for an accusative noun after the main verb. This is the subject of the indirect statement.

Example: "Putō **regem**..." (I think [about] the king...)

### Step 3: Find the Infinitive
Look for an infinitive form. This is the "verb" of the indirect statement.

Example: "Putō regem **esse**..." (I think that the king **to be**...)

### Step 4: Determine the Infinitive's Tense
- Present infinitive (-re, -ēre, -ere, -īre, esse) = same time
- Perfect infinitive (-isse) = before
- Future infinitive (-ūrus esse) = after

Example: "esse" = present infinitive = same time as "I think" = "is"

### Step 5: Translate as "that..." Clause
Put it together with English "that":

"Putō regem esse bonum." → "I think **that the king is good**."

### Step 6: Check Agreement
Make sure any adjectives agree with the accusative subject:
- regem (acc. masc. sing.) → bonum (acc. masc. sing.) ✓

---

## Part 9: Practice Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Present
**Latin**: Verb of head/heart/speech + accusative noun + esse + adjective
**Example**: Crēdō mātrem esse bonam. (I believe that the mother is good.)

### Pattern 2: Perfect Infinitive (Prior Action)
**Latin**: Verb + accusative noun + perfect infinitive
**Example**: Audiō mīlitēs vīcisse. (I hear that the soldiers have conquered / I hear that the soldiers conquered.)

### Pattern 3: With Genitive Modifier
**Latin**: Verb + accusative noun + genitive modifier + esse + adjective
**Example**: Dīcō vitam rēgis esse miseram. (I say that the king's life is wretched.)

### Pattern 4: Negative Statement
**Latin**: Verb + accusative noun + adjective + nōn esse
**Example**: Putō puellam bonam nōn esse. (I think that the girl is not good.)

---

## Summary

You now understand the most complex construction in beginning Latin:

**Indirect Statement (Accusative + Infinitive)**

Key Points:
1. **Infinitives** are verb forms (present, perfect, future) that can function as nouns
2. **Verbs of saying, thinking, and perceiving** introduce indirect statement
3. **Accusative + Infinitive** is the Latin pattern (no "that" word)
4. The **accusative is the subject** of the infinitive, NOT the object of the main verb
5. **Infinitive tense is relative**: present = same time, perfect = before, future = after
6. **Adjectives agree** with the accusative subject in gender, number, and case
7. Translate with English "**that...**" clause

### Mastery Checklist

You've mastered this concept when you can:
- ✓ Form present and perfect infinitives from any verb
- ✓ Identify verbs that take indirect statement
- ✓ Recognize accusative subjects in indirect statement
- ✓ Distinguish accusative subjects from accusative objects
- ✓ Apply relative tense rules (present infinitive with past main verb = "was")
- ✓ Translate complex indirect statements with modifiers
- ✓ Transform direct statements into indirect statements

**Next Steps**: This construction appears constantly in Latin literature. You'll see it in Caesar's military reports ("He said that the enemy had fled"), in Cicero's speeches ("I believe that the republic is in danger"), and in Nepos' biographies ("They say that he was a great general").

Mastering indirect statement opens the door to reading authentic Latin authors. Well done on reaching this milestone!

---

**Study Tip**: Create transformation drills. Take any simple Latin sentence and practice converting it to indirect statement:
- Direct: "Puella bona est." → Indirect: "Dīcō puellam bonam esse."
- Direct: "Mīlitēs pugnāvērunt." → Indirect: "Narrō mīlitēs pugnāvisse."

The more you practice, the more natural this construction will feel!
