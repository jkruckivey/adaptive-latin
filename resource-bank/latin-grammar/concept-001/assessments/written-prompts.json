In English, we mainly use word order: 'The girl sees the boy' is different from 'The boy sees the girl' - the position tells us who's doing what. But Latin uses special endings called cases instead. For example, 'puella' (the girl) changes to 'puellam' when she's being seen rather than doing the seeing. There are five cases, each with different functions: nominative for subjects, accusative for direct objects, genitive for possession, dative for indirect objects, and ablative for various 'by/with/from' meanings. This system allows Latin to have flexible word order - you can emphasize different words by moving them around, because the endings always tell you each word's grammatical role. So 'Puella viam videt' (the girl sees the road) and 'Viam puella videt' mean exactly the same thing - the endings tell you that puella (ending in -a) is the subject and viam (ending in -am) is the object, regardless of their position in the sentence."
