# First Declension Nouns + Sum, esse (present tense)

## Welcome to Latin!

Latin is an **inflected language**, which means that words change their endings to show their function in a sentence. In English, we rely heavily on word order ("The girl loves the boy" is different from "The boy loves the girl"). In Latin, word order is flexible because the endings tell us who's doing what.

This first concept introduces you to:
1. **First declension nouns** - a pattern of endings for (mostly feminine) nouns
2. **The verb sum** - the irregular but essential verb "to be"

## Part 1: First Declension Nouns

### What is a Declension?

A **declension** is a pattern of endings that nouns follow. Latin has five declensions, but we'll start with the first - the simplest and most common pattern.

### Identifying First Declension Nouns

First declension nouns:
- End in **-a** in the nominative singular (dictionary form)
- End in **-ae** in the genitive singular
- Are almost always **feminine** (with rare exceptions like nauta, "sailor")

**Dictionary Entry Format**: puella, puellae, f. (girl)
- puella = nominative singular
- puellae = genitive singular
- f. = feminine gender

### The First Declension Paradigm

Here's how **puella** (girl) declines:

| Case | Singular | Plural | Function |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Nominative** | puell**a** | puell**ae** | Subject |
| **Genitive** | puell**ae** | puell**ārum** | Possession ("of") |
| **Dative** | puell**ae** | puell**īs** | Indirect object ("to/for") |
| **Accusative** | puell**am** | puell**ās** | Direct object |
| **Ablative** | puell**ā** | puell**īs** | Various ("by/with/from") |

**Notice**:
- The **stem** is puell-
- The **endings** change based on the noun's function
- Some endings are the same (dative and ablative plural both -īs; genitive, dative, nominative plural all could be -ae)

### Understanding the Cases

#### Nominative - Subject
The noun doing the action or being described.
- **Puella est** = The girl is

#### Genitive - Possession
Shows ownership or relationship (like English 's or "of").
- **Vita puellae** = The life of the girl = The girl's life

#### Dative - Indirect Object
The person/thing receiving something or for whom something is done.
- **Puellae donum do** = I give a gift to the girl

#### Accusative - Direct Object
The person/thing receiving the action directly.
- **Puellam video** = I see the girl

#### Ablative - Many Uses
The most versatile case with many functions:
- **Means/instrument**: "by/with" (cum puellā = with the girl)
- **Place where**: "in/on" (in viā = on the road)
- **Time when**: "at/in" (multā nocte = at late night)
- And others we'll learn later

## Part 2: The Verb Sum, esse (to be)

### Why Start with Sum?

**Sum** (I am) is the most common verb in Latin, but it's **irregular** - it doesn't follow the normal patterns. We learn it first because:
1. It's essential for simple sentences
2. It appears constantly
3. It's best to memorize it early

### Present Tense of Sum

| Person | Singular | English | Plural | English |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1st | **sum** | I am | **sumus** | we are |
| 2nd | **es** | you are | **estis** | you (pl.) are |
| 3rd | **est** | he/she/it is | **sunt** | they are |

**Memory Tips**:
- **sum** → I am (sounds like "some")
- **sumus** → we are (sum + mus)
- **est** → is (like "est" in Spanish/French)
- **sunt** → they are (think "sunt" = "some" are)

**Important**: Latin doesn't need pronouns! The verb ending tells you the person.
- sum = I am (ego sum is emphatic: "**I** am")
- est = he/she/it is (context tells you which)

### Using Sum with Nouns

When sum connects a subject to a description, both nouns are in the **nominative case**.

**Puella est** = The girl is
**Puella est bona** = The girl is good (bona is nominative, agrees with puella)

Note: We'll learn adjectives in Concept 004, but for now, know that descriptions after "est" take the nominative case.

## Putting It Together: Simple Sentences

### Sentence Pattern 1: Subject + est
**Via est** = The road is (there is a road)
**Terra est** = The land is (there is land)

### Sentence Pattern 2: Subject + Object + Verb
Even though we haven't learned regular verbs yet, you'll see this pattern:
**Puella viam videt** = The girl sees the road
- puella (nominative) = subject
- viam (accusative) = direct object
- videt = he/she/it sees

### Word Order in Latin

**English**: strict word order (Subject - Verb - Object)
**Latin**: flexible word order (endings show function)

These all mean "The girl sees the road":
- Puella viam videt
- Viam puella videt
- Videt puella viam
- Puella videt viam

The most common order is **Subject - Object - Verb**, but poets and authors vary this for emphasis.

## Practice Vocabulary

Memorize these first declension nouns:

| Latin | Genitive | Gender | English |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| puella | puellae | f. | girl |
| via | viae | f. | road, way, street |
| porta | portae | f. | gate, door, entrance |
| vita | vitae | f. | life |
| terra | terrae | f. | land, earth, ground |
| aqua | aquae | f. | water |
| fama | famae | f. | fame, reputation, rumor |
| fortuna | fortunae | f. | fortune, luck |
| patria | patriae | f. | fatherland, native country |
| silva | silvae | f. | forest, woods |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Assuming -ae is always plural
**Wrong thinking**: "puellae = girls"

**Reality**: -ae can be:
- Nominative plural (the girls)
- Genitive singular (of the girl)
- Dative singular (to/for the girl)

**How to know?** Context and other words in the sentence.

### Mistake 2: Confusing ablative and dative singular
Both end in -ae... wait, no!
- Dative singular: puell**ae** (to the girl)
- Ablative singular: puell**ā** (with the girl)

The ablative has a **long -ā** (macron). In texts without macrons, you determine from context.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting that cases show function, not position
**English**: "The girl sees the road" (position shows function)
**Latin**: **Viam puella videt** (viam is accusative, so it's the object, even though it comes first)

### Mistake 4: Adding pronouns unnecessarily
**Wrong**: ego sum = I am (unless emphasizing "**I** am, not you")
**Right**: sum = I am (the ending tells us)

## Key Terminology

**Declension**: A pattern of noun endings

**Case**: The form of a noun that shows its function (nominative, genitive, etc.)

**Inflection**: Changing a word's ending to show its grammatical function

**Stem**: The base of a word to which endings are added (puell- is the stem of puella)

**Gender**: Grammatical classification (masculine, feminine, neuter) - not always related to natural gender

**Macron**: The long mark (ā) showing a long vowel - affects pronunciation and sometimes distinguishes cases

## Summary

You now know:

✓ First declension nouns end in -a (nom. sg.) and -ae (gen. sg.)
✓ Five cases each with specific functions (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative)
✓ Case endings show function, not word position
✓ The present tense of sum, esse (to be)
✓ sum, es, est, sumus, estis, sunt
✓ Simple Latin sentence patterns

**Next**: Once you've mastered these foundations, you'll learn first conjugation regular verbs, which follow a much more predictable pattern than sum!

## Quick Reference: First Declension Endings

Memorize this paradigm:

```
SINGULAR        PLURAL
-a (nom)        -ae (nom)
-ae (gen)       -ārum (gen)
-ae (dat)       -īs (dat)
-am (acc)       -ās (acc)
-ā (abl)        -īs (abl)
```

## Quick Reference: Sum, esse (present)

```
SINGULAR        PLURAL
sum (I am)      sumus (we are)
es (you are)    estis (you [pl.] are)
est (is)        sunt (they are)
```

**Study Tip**: Make flashcards for the vocabulary and practice declining each noun out loud. The more you repeat the paradigm (puella, puellae, puellae, puellam, puellā...), the more automatic it becomes!
