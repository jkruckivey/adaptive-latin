For second declension neuter nouns like bellum (war), this means bellum serves as both nominative singular (subject) and accusative singular (direct object). In the plural, bella is both nominative plural and accusative plural. This rule matters for translation because you cannot tell from the form alone whether a neuter noun is the subject or object of a sentence - you must rely on context. For example, in 'Bellum est' (the war is), bellum must be nominative because 'est' needs a subject. But in 'Bellum video' (I see the war), bellum must be accusative because 'video' needs a direct object - even though the form is identical. Similarly, 'Dōna sunt bona' (the gifts are good) uses dōna as nominative plural (subject), while 'Dōna video' (I see the gifts) uses the exact same form dōna as accusative plural (object). The verb and sentence structure tell you which case the neuter noun is functioning as, making context critical for accurate translation."
