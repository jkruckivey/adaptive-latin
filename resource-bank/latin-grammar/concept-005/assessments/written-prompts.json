      "sample_excellent_response": "The perfect and imperfect tenses in Latin both refer to past time, but they differ in aspect - how the action is viewed. The perfect tense uses the perfect stem (from the third principal part, like amāv- from amāvī) and expresses a completed action: 'I loved' or 'I have loved.' The imperfect tense uses the present stem (from the infinitive, like amā- from amāre) plus the -ba- marker and expresses an ongoing or habitual past action: 'I was loving' or 'I used to love.'\n\nConsider these examples: 'Puellam amāvī' (I loved the girl / I have loved the girl) uses perfect to show a completed action - it happened and it's done. But 'Puellam amābam' (I was loving the girl / I used to love the girl) uses imperfect to show the action was ongoing or repeated in the past. Another example: 'Litterās scrīpsī' (I wrote the letter - completed) vs. 'Litterās scrībēbam' (I was writing the letter - ongoing).\n\nStudents often confuse these because both refer to past time. The key to avoiding confusion is checking the stem: if you see the perfect stem (like amāv-, vocāv-, ded-), it's perfect system. If you see the present stem with -ba- (like amā-ba-, vocā-ba-, dā-ba-), it's imperfect. Also remember the aspect: perfect = done/completed, imperfect = was doing/used to do. When translating, ask yourself: is this a completed action or an ongoing/habitual one? That will guide you to the right tense."
