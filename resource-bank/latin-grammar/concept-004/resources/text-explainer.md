# Adjectives (1st/2nd Declension) + Agreement

## Introduction: What Are Adjectives?

Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns. In English, adjectives are simple: "good girl," "large house," "many roads." The adjective stays the same regardless of the noun.

**Latin is different**. Latin adjectives must **agree** with the nouns they modify - but not in the way you might think! This is the single most important concept in this lesson, and the most commonly misunderstood.

---

## Part 1: The Agreement Rule (Critical!)

### The Rule That Changes Everything

**AGREEMENT RULE**: An adjective must match its noun in three ways:
1. **Gender** (masculine, feminine, or neuter)
2. **Number** (singular or plural)
3. **Case** (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative)

**CRITICAL**: Adjectives do NOT need to have the same ending as their noun!

### Why This Matters: The Common Mistake

Many students see "bonus puella" and think: "That's wrong! Bonus ends in -us and puella ends in -a. They don't match!"

**Wrong thinking**: "Bonus and puella have different endings, so they can't go together."

**Correct thinking**: "Bonus is masculine nominative singular. Puella is feminine nominative singular. They're both nominative singular (✓), but different genders. So bonus must change to its FEMININE form to match puella's gender: bona puella."

### The Truth About Agreement

Agreement means matching **gender, number, and case** - NOT matching **endings**.

**Example**:
- **bonus amicus** (good friend) - BOTH masculine nominative singular
  - bonus: M nom sg
  - amicus: M nom sg
  - Endings match (-us + -us) because both happen to be 2nd declension masculine

- **bona puella** (good girl) - BOTH feminine nominative singular
  - bona: F nom sg (adjective takes 1st declension feminine ending)
  - puella: F nom sg (noun is 1st declension)
  - Endings DON'T match (-a + -a happens to match here, but that's coincidence)

- **bonum bellum** (good war) - BOTH neuter nominative singular
  - bonum: N nom sg
  - bellum: N nom sg
  - Endings match (-um + -um) because both are 2nd declension neuter

**The pattern**: The adjective takes whatever ending expresses the correct gender, number, and case - regardless of what declension the noun uses.

## Part 2: 1st/2nd Declension Adjectives

### The Paradigm: bonus, bona, bonum (good)

1st/2nd declension adjectives have THREE forms in the dictionary entry:
- **bonus** (masculine, uses 2nd declension endings)
- **bona** (feminine, uses 1st declension endings)
- **bonum** (neuter, uses 2nd declension endings)

**Full Paradigm**:

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **SINGULAR** | | | |
| Nominative | bon**us** | bon**a** | bon**um** |
| Genitive | bon**ī** | bon**ae** | bon**ī** |
| Dative | bon**ō** | bon**ae** | bon**ō** |
| Accusative | bon**um** | bon**am** | bon**um** |
| Ablative | bon**ō** | bon**ā** | bon**ō** |
| **PLURAL** | | | |
| Nominative | bon**ī** | bon**ae** | bon**a** |
| Genitive | bon**ōrum** | bon**ārum** | bon**ōrum** |
| Dative | bon**īs** | bon**īs** | bon**īs** |
| Accusative | bon**ōs** | bon**ās** | bon**a** |
| Ablative | bon**īs** | bon**īs** | bon**īs** |

**Key Observations**:
- Masculine uses 2nd declension **-us** endings (like amicus)
- Feminine uses 1st declension **-a** endings (like puella)
- Neuter uses 2nd declension **-um** endings (like bellum)
- The stem is **bon-**
- Dative and ablative plural are identical across all genders (-īs)

### Why Three Forms?

Students often ask: "Why does bonus have three forms (-us, -a, -um) in the dictionary?"

**Answer**: Because adjectives must be able to modify nouns of any gender.

- To modify masculine nouns: use bonus (M), bonī (M), bonō (M)...
- To modify feminine nouns: use bona (F), bonae (F), bonae (F)...
- To modify neuter nouns: use bonum (N), bonī (N), bonō (N)...

The dictionary gives you all three nominative singular forms so you know how to decline it in all genders.

## Part 3: Applying Agreement

### Step-by-Step Process

When using an adjective with a noun:

**Step 1**: Identify the noun's gender, number, and case
**Step 2**: Make the adjective match in gender, number, and case
**Step 3**: Find the correct adjective ending for that gender/number/case combination

### Examples

**Example 1**: "good girl" (subject)
- Noun: puella (feminine, singular, nominative)
- Adjective must be: feminine, singular, nominative
- Look at bonus paradigm, F nom sg = **bona**
- Result: **bona puella**

**Example 2**: "of the good friend" (masculine)
- Noun: amicus → amicī (masculine, singular, genitive)
- Adjective must be: masculine, singular, genitive
- Look at bonus paradigm, M gen sg = **bonī**
- Result: **bonī amicī** (Wait! Both end in -ī? That's fine - they're both M gen sg)

Actually, let me fix that: **amicī bonī** or **bonī amicī** (word order flexible)

**Example 3**: "I see good wars"
- Noun: bellum → bella (neuter, plural, accusative)
- Adjective must be: neuter, plural, accusative
- Look at bonus paradigm, N acc pl = **bona**
- Result: **bona bella video** (I see good wars)
- Note: Both end in -a, but for different reasons (neuter plural vs. feminine singular looks similar!)

**Example 4**: "with large roads"
- Noun: via → viīs (feminine, plural, ablative)
- Adjective: magnus, magna, magnum → must be F pl abl
- Look at magnus paradigm, F abl pl = **magnīs**
- Result: **cum magnīs viīs** (with large roads)
- Note: viīs is F abl pl (1st decl), magnīs is F abl pl (adjective)

**Example 5**: The Tricky One - "good girls" (direct object)
- Noun: puella → puellās (feminine, plural, accusative)
- Adjective must be: feminine, plural, accusative
- Look at bonus paradigm, F acc pl = **bonās**
- Result: **bonās puellās video** (I see good girls)
- Note: Both end in -ās because they're both F acc pl!

### When Endings Match vs. Don't Match

**Endings WILL match when**:
- Masculine adjective + masculine 2nd declension noun (same declension pattern)
- Feminine adjective + feminine 1st declension noun (same declension pattern)
- Neuter adjective + neuter 2nd declension noun (same declension pattern)

**Endings WON'T match when**:
- Any adjective + 3rd declension noun (you'll learn this in Concept 006)
- Sometimes even with 1st/2nd declension due to irregular forms

**The lesson**: Stop looking for matching endings. Look for matching gender/number/case.

## Part 4: Attributive vs. Predicate Adjectives

### Attributive Adjectives

**Attributive adjectives** directly modify a noun - they "attribute" a quality to it.

**English**: "The good girl sees the road"
**Latin**: **Bona puella viam videt**

The adjective "bona" directly modifies "puella" - they form a phrase ("good girl").

**Position**: Attributive adjectives can come before OR after the noun in Latin
- **Bona puella** = good girl (adjective first - more emphasis)
- **Puella bona** = good girl (noun first - normal order)

Both mean the same thing. Latin word order is flexible.

### Predicate Adjectives

**Predicate adjectives** describe the subject through a linking verb (usually "est" or other forms of sum).

**English**: "The girl is good"
**Latin**: **Puella est bona** or **Puella bona est**

Here, "bona" is NOT directly modifying "puella" as part of a noun phrase. Instead, it's a description given through the linking verb "est."

**Key difference**:
- Attributive: **Bona puella est** = The good girl is (here)
- Predicate: **Puella bona est** = The girl is good

**Both use nominative case** because the adjective refers to the subject!

### How to Tell the Difference

**Attributive**: Adjective + Noun (or Noun + Adjective) form a unit
- Bonus amicus viam videt = The good friend sees the road
- Viam bonam video = I see the good road

**Predicate**: Subject + est/sunt + Adjective
- Amicus bonus est = The friend is good
- Via bona est = The road is good

**Agreement still applies**: In both cases, the adjective must match the noun's gender, number, and case.

## Part 5: Common Vocabulary

Memorize these essential 1st/2nd declension adjectives:

| Latin | English | Pattern |
|-------|---------|---------|
| bonus, bona, bonum | good | regular -us, -a, -um |
| magnus, magna, magnum | large, great | regular -us, -a, -um |
| parvus, parva, parvum | small | regular -us, -a, -um |
| multus, multa, multum | much, many | regular -us, -a, -um |
| meus, mea, meum | my, mine | regular -us, -a, -um |
| tuus, tua, tuum | your, yours | regular -us, -a, -um |
| pulcher, pulchra, pulchrum | beautiful, handsome | -er, -ra, -rum (note spelling) |

**Note on pulcher**: Like ager (field) from 2nd declension nouns, pulcher keeps its -e- in the masculine nominative singular only. All other forms drop it: pulchrī, pulchrō, pulchrum, etc.

---

## Part 6: Practice Patterns

### Declining Adjective + Noun Pairs

Let's decline "good girl" through all cases:

| Case | Latin | English |
|------|-------|---------|
| Nominative | bona puella | the good girl (subject) |
| Genitive | bonae puellae | of the good girl |
| Dative | bonae puellae | to/for the good girl |
| Accusative | bonam puellam | the good girl (object) |
| Ablative | bonā puellā | with/by the good girl |

**Notice**: Both words change their endings, but they ALWAYS match in gender (F), number (sg), and case.

**Plural**:

| Case | Latin | English |
|------|-------|---------|
| Nominative | bonae puellae | the good girls (subject) |
| Genitive | bonārum puellārum | of the good girls |
| Dative | bonīs puellīs | to/for the good girls |
| Accusative | bonās puellās | the good girls (object) |
| Ablative | bonīs puellīs | with/by the good girls |

### Mixed Gender Practice

**Masculine**: "large friend"

| Case | Latin | Translation |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Nom sg | magnus amicus | the large friend |
| Gen sg | magnī amicī | of the large friend |
| Acc sg | magnum amicum | the large friend (obj) |

**Neuter**: "small gift"

| Case | Latin | Translation |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Nom sg | parvum donum | the small gift |
| Gen sg | parvī donī | of the small gift |
| Acc sg | parvum donum | the small gift (obj) |
| Nom pl | parva dona | the small gifts |

**Notice the neuter rule still applies**: Nominative = Accusative (parvum donum in both sg, parva dona in both pl)

## Part 7: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Thinking Endings Must Match

**Wrong**: "Bonus puella - they don't have the same ending, so this must be wrong."

**Right**: "Bonus is masculine. Puella is feminine. I need the feminine form of bonus, which is bona. So: bona puella."

**Correction process**:
1. Check noun's gender (puella = F)
2. Find adjective's matching gender form (bona = F form of bonus)
3. Apply same case and number (nom sg)

### Mistake 2: Confusing Gender Agreement with Declension Pattern

**Wrong**: "Puella is 1st declension, so I use 1st declension endings for the adjective."

**Right**: "Puella is FEMININE (and happens to be 1st declension). I use the feminine forms of the adjective, which happen to follow 1st declension pattern. But I'm matching GENDER, not declension."

**Why this matters**: Later you'll meet 3rd declension feminine nouns (like mater, mother). You'll STILL use bona (feminine form) with them, even though mater isn't 1st declension:
- **bona mater** (good mother) - feminine agreement, different declensions

### Mistake 3: Forgetting Neuter Plural -a

**Wrong**: Thinking "bona" can only be feminine singular nominative

**Right**: "Bona" can be:
- Feminine singular nominative (bona puella = good girl)
- Feminine singular ablative (bonā puellā - wait, that has a macron)
- Neuter plural nominative (bona bella = good wars)
- Neuter plural accusative (bona bella = good wars as object)

**Context tells you which!**

### Mistake 4: Rigid Word Order

**Wrong**: "The adjective must come before the noun in Latin."

**Right**: Both orders are correct:
- **Bona puella** (good girl) - adjective first, more emphatic
- **Puella bona** (good girl) - noun first, standard order

**Same meaning, different emphasis.**

### Mistake 5: Not Recognizing Predicate Adjectives

**Wrong**: Translating "Puella bona est" as "The good girl is" (incomplete sentence)

**Right**: "The girl is good" - bona is predicate adjective, not attributive

**How to tell**: Is there a form of sum (est, sunt, etc.) separating or near the adjective? Then it's likely predicate.

## Part 8: Translation Strategy

### From Latin to English

**Step 1**: Identify all nouns and their case/number/gender
**Step 2**: Identify all adjectives and their case/number/gender
**Step 3**: Match adjectives to nouns by agreement (same G/N/C)
**Step 4**: Translate noun-adjective pairs as units
**Step 5**: Translate the sentence

**Example**: **Magnās viās bonae puellae vident**

Step 1 - Nouns:
- viās: F acc pl (roads - direct object)
- puellae: F nom pl (girls - subject)

Step 2 - Adjectives:
- magnās: F acc pl (large)
- bonae: F nom pl (good)

Step 3 - Match:
- magnās matches viās (both F acc pl) → large roads
- bonae matches puellae (both F nom pl) → good girls

Step 4 - Pairs:
- magnās viās = large roads (direct object)
- bonae puellae = good girls (subject)

Step 5 - Translate:
- vident = they see
- **"The good girls see the large roads"**

### From English to Latin

**Step 1**: Identify nouns and their function (subject, object, etc.)
**Step 2**: Determine case for each noun based on function
**Step 3**: Determine gender/number for each noun
**Step 4**: For each adjective, match the G/N/C of its noun
**Step 5**: Find correct adjective form
**Step 6**: Arrange in Latin word order (flexible, but typical is SOV)

**Example**: "I see small gifts"

Step 1 - Nouns:
- gifts (direct object)

Step 2 - Case:
- gifts = accusative (direct object)

Step 3 - G/N:
- donum, donī, n. (gift) → neuter plural

Step 4 - Adjective match:
- small → parvus, parva, parvum
- Must match "gifts": neuter plural accusative

Step 5 - Form:
- parvus paradigm, N acc pl = parva
- donum declined, N acc pl = dona

Step 6 - Latin:
- **Parva dona video** (small gifts I-see)

## Summary

You now understand:

✓ **Agreement rule**: Adjectives match nouns in gender, number, case - NOT ending
✓ **1st/2nd declension adjectives**: Three forms (M -us, F -a, N -um) using familiar endings
✓ **Why three forms**: Adjectives must be able to modify any gender noun
✓ **Attributive vs. predicate**: Direct modification vs. description through "est"
✓ **Flexible word order**: Adjective can precede or follow noun
✓ **Common mistakes**: Stop looking for matching endings; focus on matching G/N/C

**Most Important Takeaway**:

When you see **bonus amicus** (M + M, same endings) and **bona puella** (F + F, different-looking endings), your brain wants to think the first is "right" and the second is "wrong."

**Resist that instinct!**

Both are perfectly correct because:
- bonus matches amicus in M, sg, nom ✓
- bona matches puella in F, sg, nom ✓

The endings look different because one is 2nd declension masculine and the other is 1st declension feminine - but that's IRRELEVANT. What matters is they both express the same gender, number, and case as their nouns.

**Master this concept, and you've conquered one of Latin's most challenging ideas!**

## Quick Reference: Bonus Paradigm

```
           MASC    FEM     NEUT
Nom sg     bonus   bona    bonum
Gen sg     bonī    bonae   bonī
Dat sg     bonō    bonae   bonō
Acc sg     bonum   bonam   bonum
Abl sg     bonō    bonā    bonō

Nom pl     bonī    bonae   bona
Gen pl     bonōrum bonārum bonōrum
Dat pl     bonīs   bonīs   bonīs
Acc pl     bonōs   bonās   bona
Abl pl     bonīs   bonīs   bonīs
```

---

**Practice Tip**: Take a noun from Concept 001 (1st decl) and a noun from Concept 003 (2nd decl). Decline each with the adjective "bonus" through all cases. This will cement the agreement pattern in your mind!
