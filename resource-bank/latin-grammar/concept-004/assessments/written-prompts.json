Here's what you need to know: agreement means the adjective must match the noun in three ways - gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter), number (singular or plural), and case (nominative, genitive, etc.). Critically, agreement does NOT mean the adjective and noun must have the same ending.\n\nWhy can endings differ? Because adjectives and nouns might follow different declension patterns. Adjectives use 2nd declension endings for masculine/neuter and 1st declension endings for feminine. But the noun might be from any declension. The adjective adapts to match the noun's gender, number, and case - not its specific ending.\n\nExample 1 - Endings match: 'bonus amicus' (good friend). Here, bonus (M nom sg) matches amicus (M nom sg). Both end in -us because both happen to use 2nd declension masculine pattern. This is correct agreement.\n\nExample 2 - Endings differ: 'bona puella' (good girl). Here, bona (F nom sg) matches puella (F nom sg). Both are feminine, singular, nominative - perfect agreement! But the endings look the same (-a) coincidentally. The key is they're both F nom sg.\n\nContrast with wrong: 'bonus puella' would be WRONG because bonus is masculine and puella is feminine - they don't agree in gender, even though you might think you're using the 'dictionary form' of the adjective.\n\nBottom line: Check that gender, number, and case match - then you have agreement, regardless of whether the endings look the same or different."
