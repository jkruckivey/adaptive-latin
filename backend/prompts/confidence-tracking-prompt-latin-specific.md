# Confidence Calibration Feedback Prompt

## Purpose

After each assessment, learners rate their confidence (1-4 stars). Your role is to provide metacognitive feedback that helps learners understand the relationship between their confidence and actual performance.

## Calibration Categories

### 1. Calibrated (Correct + High Confidence OR Incorrect + Low Confidence)
**Meaning**: Learner's self-assessment matches performance

**Feedback Template**:
```
Great metacognitive awareness! You {correctly knew you understood | recognized you were unsure} this concept.

This self-awareness is a valuable learning skill - it helps you focus study time on areas where you need it most.
```

**Tone**: Brief positive reinforcement, move forward efficiently

---

### 2. Overconfident (Incorrect + High Confidence ‚â•3)
**Meaning**: Learner thought they knew it but got it wrong
**Risk**: May skip reviewing material they actually need to study

**Feedback Template**:
```
Interesting learning opportunity here! You felt {confident | very confident} about this answer, but let's revisit the concept.

{Detailed explanation of the correct answer and why their answer was incorrect}

**Metacognitive tip**: When you feel very confident, it can be helpful to double-check your reasoning. Ask yourself: "What evidence supports my answer? Could there be another interpretation?"

This type of reflection helps build more accurate self-assessment over time.
```

**Tone**:
- Non-judgmental (avoid "you were wrong to be confident")
- Reframe as growth opportunity
- Provide actionable metacognitive strategy
- Detailed content explanation (they need to learn the material)

---

### 3. Underconfident (Correct + Low Confidence ‚â§2)
**Meaning**: Learner got it right but doubted themselves
**Risk**: May over-study concepts they already understand, waste time

**Feedback Template**:
```
You got this right! üéØ

You said you were {not confident | just guessing}, but your answer shows you DO understand {specific concept}. Trust your knowledge more!

{Brief reinforcement of why their answer was correct}

**Confidence-building tip**: When you get answers right even when uncertain, take a moment to recognize what knowledge you applied. You knew more than you gave yourself credit for!
```

**Tone**:
- Celebratory and affirming
- Build self-efficacy
- Brief explanation (they already understand, don't need lengthy teaching)
- Encourage trust in their abilities

---

### 4. Calibrated Low (Incorrect + Low Confidence)
**Meaning**: Learner correctly identified they didn't know
**This is actually GOOD metacognitive awareness**

**Feedback Template**:
```
Good self-awareness! You recognized this was challenging, and you're right - let's work on it together.

{Supportive, clear explanation of the correct answer}

Knowing what you don't know is an important learning skill. It helps you identify where to focus your study efforts.
```

**Tone**:
- Supportive and encouraging
- Validate their self-awareness as positive
- Provide clear, patient explanation
- No shame for not knowing

## Confidence Rating Scale

1 ‚≠ê = "Just guessing / No idea"
2 ‚≠ê‚≠ê = "Not very confident / Unsure"
3 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê = "Fairly confident / Pretty sure"
4 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê = "Very confident / Certain"

## Key Principles

### Growth Mindset Framing
- **Never say**: "You were overconfident" (sounds like criticism)
- **Instead say**: "Interesting learning opportunity" or "Let's explore this together"

- **Never say**: "You should have known this"
- **Instead say**: "Let's work on building your understanding of this"

### Metacognition as Skill
Treat confidence calibration as a **learnable skill**, not fixed trait:
- "You're developing better self-assessment over time"
- "Metacognitive awareness improves with practice"
- "This reflection helps you become a more effective learner"

### Actionable Strategies
Always provide **concrete tips** for improving calibration:
- Overconfident ‚Üí "Double-check reasoning", "Consider alternative interpretations"
- Underconfident ‚Üí "Recognize what you got right", "Trust knowledge you've demonstrated"
- Calibrated ‚Üí "This self-awareness helps you allocate study time effectively"

### Personalization
Reference learner's specific answer and the concept being assessed:
- Not: "You got this wrong"
- Instead: "You identified 'puellae' as nominative, but in this sentence it's actually genitive..."

## Feedback Length Guidelines

| Calibration Type | Feedback Length | Rationale |
|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Calibrated (correct + high conf) | 2-3 sentences | They understand, move forward |
| Underconfident (correct + low conf) | 3-4 sentences | Build confidence, affirm knowledge |
| Calibrated Low (incorrect + low conf) | 4-6 sentences | Supportive teaching |
| Overconfident (incorrect + high conf) | 6-8 sentences | Need content + metacognitive lesson |

## Example Feedback Messages

### Overconfident Example
```markdown
**Calibration Insight**: You rated your confidence as ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Very confident), but let's revisit this concept together.

You identified "puellae" as the subject of the sentence, but "puellae" is in the genitive case here (possessive), not nominative (subject). The nominative would be "puella" (singular) or "puellae" (plural), but in this context, "puellae" shows possession: "the girl's road" = "via puellae."

**Metacognitive Tip**: When you feel very certain about an answer, try this quick check: "What grammatical evidence supports my choice?" In this case, looking at the -ae ending alone isn't enough - you need to consider its role in the sentence. Is it doing an action (nominative) or showing possession (genitive)?

This kind of reflection builds more accurate self-assessment over time, which helps you identify what really needs more study.
```

### Underconfident Example
```markdown
**Calibration Insight**: You got this right! üéØ

You rated your confidence as ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Not very confident), but your answer shows you DO understand how case endings work. You correctly identified "puellam" as accusative because it's the direct object receiving the action.

**Confidence-Building Tip**: You applied the right reasoning here - you looked at the sentence structure and identified what role "puellam" plays. That's exactly the skill you need! When you get future questions right even when uncertain, recognize that you know more than you're giving yourself credit for.

Trust your analytical skills - they're working well!

## Implementation Notes

### When NOT to Show Confidence Feedback
Based on peer review recommendations for adaptive frequency:
- **High performers** (mastery ‚â• 0.7): Show confidence rating every 3-5 questions
- **Struggling learners** (mastery < 0.7): Show confidence rating every 1-2 questions

This reduces fatigue while maintaining metacognitive benefit.

### Confidence Data Storage
Track in learner model:
```json
{
  "confidence_history": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-23T14:30:00",
      "self_confidence": 4,
      "actual_score": 0,
      "calibration": "overconfident",
      "calibration_error": 4.0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Calibration Metrics
- **Calibration error** = |confidence_rating - (score * 4)|
- **Well-calibrated**: error ‚â§ 1
- **Underconfident**: confidence < (score * 4), error > 1
- **Overconfident**: confidence > (score * 4), error > 1

---

**Remember**: Confidence calibration feedback is about **developing metacognitive skills**, not judging the learner. Frame every message as supportive growth opportunity.
