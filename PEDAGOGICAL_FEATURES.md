# Pedagogical Features - Complete Guide

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Version:** 0.5.0 (Phase 2 Complete)

## Overview

This document describes the pedagogical improvements implemented to address learner discouragement and enhance motivation. These features implement evidence-based learning science principles:

### Phase 1 Features ‚úÖ
1. **Adaptive Scaffolding** - Adjusting difficulty based on performance
2. **Choice & Agency** - Practice mode for stress-free exploration
3. **Growth Mindset** - Encouragement messages during struggle

### Phase 2 Features ‚úÖ (NEW)
4. **Spaced Repetition with Forgiveness** - Early mistakes weighted less
5. **Celebration Milestones** - Positive reinforcement for achievements
6. **Hint System** - Graduated hints in practice mode

## Feature 1: Adaptive Scaffolding

### What is Adaptive Scaffolding?

Adaptive scaffolding automatically adjusts question difficulty based on recent performance, ensuring learners are challenged appropriately without being overwhelmed.

### How It Works

**Difficulty Levels:**
- **Easier** (< 40% recent performance) - Fundamental vocabulary, basic forms, clear context clues
- **Appropriate** (40-85% performance) - Standard difficulty level
- **Harder** (> 85% performance) - Complex vocabulary, deeper analysis, subtle distractors

**Performance Calculation:**
- Tracks the last 5 questions (sliding window)
- Calculates correctness ratio (e.g., 3/5 = 60%)
- Adjusts difficulty for next question

**Example:**
```
Student answers: ‚ùå ‚ùå ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ùå  (Recent performance: 20%)
‚Üí System provides EASIER questions (back to fundamentals)

Student answers: ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚ùå  (Recent performance: 80%)
‚Üí System provides APPROPRIATE questions (maintain challenge)

Student answers: ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ  (Recent performance: 100%)
‚Üí System provides HARDER questions (increase difficulty)
```

### Adaptive Mastery Thresholds

The system also adjusts mastery expectations:

| Performance Level | Mastery Threshold | Rationale |
|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Struggling (< 40%) | 70% | Achievable wins build confidence |
| Normal (40-85%) | 75% | Standard expectation |
| Excelling (> 85%) | 85% | Higher bar for challenge |

### Implementation

**Backend Functions (backend/app/tools.py):**
```python
# Calculate recent performance
calculate_recent_performance(learner_id, concept_id, window_size=5)

# Select appropriate difficulty
select_question_difficulty(learner_id, concept_id)
# Returns: "easier", "appropriate", or "harder"

# Get adaptive mastery threshold
get_adaptive_mastery_threshold(learner_id, concept_id)
# Returns: 0.70, 0.75, or 0.85
```

**Constants (backend/app/constants.py):**
```python
DIFFICULTY_DOWN_THRESHOLD = 0.40  # Below 40% ‚Üí easier
DIFFICULTY_UP_THRESHOLD = 0.85    # Above 85% ‚Üí harder
DIFFICULTY_ASSESSMENT_WINDOW = 5  # Last 5 questions

MASTERY_THRESHOLD_STRUGGLING = 0.70  # Lower bar when struggling
MASTERY_THRESHOLD_NORMAL = 0.75      # Standard threshold (lowered from 0.85)
MASTERY_THRESHOLD_EXCELLING = 0.85   # Higher bar for high performers
```

## Feature 2: Choice & Agency (Practice Mode)

### What is Practice Mode?

Practice Mode allows learners to explore questions without affecting their mastery score. This provides psychological safety for experimentation and reduces performance anxiety.

### How It Works

**When Practice Mode is Enabled:**
- ‚úÖ Questions are generated normally
- ‚úÖ Feedback is provided on correctness
- ‚ùå Assessments **do not** count toward mastery score
- ‚ùå Incorrect answers **do not** prevent progression
- üéØ Learners can practice stress-free

**When Practice Mode is Disabled (Graded Mode):**
- ‚úÖ Questions count toward mastery
- ‚úÖ Progress toward concept completion
- ‚úÖ Normal adaptive learning flow

### Use Cases

1. **Explore Before Committing** - Preview concept difficulty
2. **Recover After Struggle** - Practice without pressure after several mistakes
3. **Review Previously Mastered** - Refresh knowledge without affecting score
4. **Experimentation** - Try different approaches risk-free

### Implementation

**Backend API Endpoint:**
```http
PUT /learner/{learner_id}/practice-mode
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "practiceMode": true  // or false
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Practice mode enabled",
  "previous_mode": false,
  "new_mode": true
}
```

**Learner Model Schema:**
```json
{
  "learner_id": "...",
  "practice_mode": false,  // Default: disabled
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Backend Function:**
```python
# In backend/app/tools.py
record_assessment_and_check_completion(
    learner_id,
    concept_id,
    is_correct,
    confidence,
    question_type,
    practice_mode=True  # Skip mastery recording
)
```

## Feature 3: Growth Mindset Encouragement

### What is Growth Mindset Encouragement?

Automatic detection of struggle with supportive messages that reframe mistakes as learning opportunities.

### How It Works

**Struggle Detection:**
- **Consecutive incorrect** (2+ wrong in a row)
- **Moderate struggle** (< 40% recent performance)
- **Mild struggle** (< 60% recent performance)

**Encouragement Messages:**

**Consecutive Incorrect:**
> üí™ Learning is a journey! These mistakes are valuable feedback. Each wrong answer helps you understand better. Keep going!

**Moderate Struggle:**
> üåü This is challenging, but you're making progress! Consider trying the preview mode or practice mode to explore without pressure. Remember: struggle means your brain is growing!

**Mild Struggle:**
> üëç You're working through some tricky material. That's exactly how learning happens! Take your time, and remember you can always review the preview.

### Implementation

**Backend Function:**
```python
# In backend/app/tools.py
struggle_info = detect_struggle(learner_id, concept_id)
# Returns: {
#   "struggle_level": "moderate",
#   "recent_performance": 0.35,
#   "consecutive_incorrect": 2,
#   "encouragement_message": "üåü This is challenging..."
# }
```

**Response Integration (backend/app/main.py):**
```python
assessment_result = {
    "type": "assessment-result",
    "score": 1.0 if is_correct else 0.0,
    "feedback": feedback_text,
    "encouragement": encouragement_message,  # Added
    "practiceMode": practice_mode,  # Added
    // ...
}
```

## Configuration Constants

All pedagogical settings are centralized in `backend/app/constants.py`:

```python
# Adaptive Scaffolding
DIFFICULTY_DOWN_THRESHOLD = 0.40
DIFFICULTY_UP_THRESHOLD = 0.85
DIFFICULTY_ASSESSMENT_WINDOW = 5
MASTERY_THRESHOLD_STRUGGLING = 0.70
MASTERY_THRESHOLD_NORMAL = 0.75
MASTERY_THRESHOLD_EXCELLING = 0.85

# Practice Mode
PRACTICE_MODE_ENABLED = True
PRACTICE_MODE_DEFAULT = False
PRACTICE_MODE_SHOWS_ANSWERS = True
PRACTICE_MODE_ALLOWS_HINTS = True
PRACTICE_MODE_COUNTS_TOWARD_MASTERY = False

# Encouragement
STRUGGLE_THRESHOLD_MILD = 0.60
STRUGGLE_THRESHOLD_MODERATE = 0.40
STRUGGLE_DETECTION_WINDOW = 5
ENCOURAGEMENT_AFTER_N_INCORRECT = 2
```

## Frontend Integration (To Be Implemented)

### Practice Mode Toggle

**Location:** Learning interface header

**UI Component:**
```jsx
<PracticeModeToggle
  enabled={practiceMode}
  onChange={(enabled) => togglePracticeMode(enabled)}
/>
```

**Visual Indicator:**
- üéØ **Practice Mode** (green badge) - When enabled
- üìä **Graded Mode** (blue badge) - When disabled

### Encouragement Display

**Location:** Assessment result screen

**UI Component:**
```jsx
{encouragement && (
  <EncouragementMessage message={encouragement} />
)}
```

**Visual Style:**
- Warm color scheme (orange/yellow gradient)
- Icon indicating support (üí™, üåü, üëç)
- Friendly, non-judgmental tone

### Difficulty Indicator (Optional)

**Location:** Debug panel or settings

**Display:**
- Current difficulty level
- Recent performance graph
- Adaptive threshold visualization

## Benefits

### 1. Reduced Discouragement
- **Problem:** High mastery threshold (85%) felt unattainable
- **Solution:** Adaptive thresholds (70-85%) based on performance
- **Impact:** More achievable goals ‚Üí sustained motivation

### 2. Increased Agency
- **Problem:** Learners felt trapped in assessment cycle
- **Solution:** Practice mode for stress-free exploration
- **Impact:** Psychological safety ‚Üí willingness to experiment

### 3. Appropriate Challenge
- **Problem:** One-size-fits-all difficulty caused frustration
- **Solution:** Dynamic difficulty adjustment (easier/appropriate/harder)
- **Impact:** Flow state ‚Üí optimal learning

### 4. Growth Mindset
- **Problem:** Mistakes felt like failures
- **Solution:** Encouragement messages reframe errors as learning
- **Impact:** Resilience ‚Üí persistence through difficulty

## Testing

### Backend Testing

**Test adaptive scaffolding:**
```bash
cd backend
python -c "
from app.tools import select_question_difficulty
# Simulate struggling learner (20% performance)
difficulty = select_question_difficulty('test-learner', 'concept-001')
print(f'Difficulty: {difficulty}')  # Should be 'easier'
"
```

**Test practice mode:**
```bash
# Toggle practice mode
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/learner/test-learner/practice-mode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"practiceMode": true}'

# Submit answer in practice mode (won't count toward mastery)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/submit-response \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "learner_id": "test-learner",
    "current_concept": "concept-001",
    "user_answer": 0,
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "is_correct": false
  }'
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Adaptive difficulty adjusts after 5 questions
- [ ] Practice mode toggle updates learner model
- [ ] Practice mode assessments don't affect mastery score
- [ ] Encouragement messages appear after 2+ incorrect answers
- [ ] Mastery threshold adapts to performance level

## Future Enhancements

1. **Frontend Practice Mode Toggle** - Visual UI component
2. **Difficulty Visualization** - Show current difficulty level to learners
3. **Performance Analytics** - Dashboard showing difficulty progression
4. **Hint System** - Contextual hints in practice mode
5. **Preview Skip Option** - Let learners skip directly to assessment
6. **Restart Diagnostic** - Ability to restart if learner feels unprepared

## Feature 4: Spaced Repetition with Forgiveness (Phase 2)

### What is Spaced Repetition with Forgiveness?

This feature prevents early mistakes from permanently hurting a learner's mastery score. The first few questions are weighted less, recognizing that initial attempts are part of the learning process.

### How It Works

**Weighted Mastery Calculation:**
- **Learning Phase** (first 3 questions): 50% weight
- **Mastery Phase** (questions 4+): 100% weight

**Example:**
```
Question 1: ‚ùå (score: 0, weight: 0.5) ‚Üí weighted: 0.0
Question 2: ‚ùå (score: 0, weight: 0.5) ‚Üí weighted: 0.0
Question 3: ‚úÖ (score: 1, weight: 0.5) ‚Üí weighted: 0.5
Question 4: ‚úÖ (score: 1, weight: 1.0) ‚Üí weighted: 1.0
Question 5: ‚úÖ (score: 1, weight: 1.0) ‚Üí weighted: 1.0

Total weight: 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.5
Total weighted score: 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 2.5
Mastery: 2.5 / 3.5 = 71.4%

Without forgiveness: 3/5 = 60% (would fail)
With forgiveness: 71.4% (passing!)
```

### Benefits

- **Reduces discouragement** from initial fumbling
- **Encourages exploration** without fear of permanent damage
- **Reflects learning reality** - we all struggle at first
- **Still maintains standards** - later questions count fully

### Implementation

**Backend Function (backend/app/tools.py:544-586):**
```python
# In calculate_mastery()
for i, score in enumerate(scores):
    if i < LEARNING_PHASE_QUESTIONS:  # First 3 questions
        weight = LEARNING_PHASE_WEIGHT  # 50% weight
    else:
        weight = MASTERY_PHASE_WEIGHT   # 100% weight

    weighted_scores.append(score * weight)
    total_weight += weight

weighted_avg = sum(weighted_scores) / total_weight
```

**Constants:**
```python
LEARNING_PHASE_QUESTIONS = 3  # First 3 questions
LEARNING_PHASE_WEIGHT = 0.5   # 50% weight
MASTERY_PHASE_WEIGHT = 1.0    # 100% weight
```

## Feature 5: Celebration Milestones (Phase 2)

### What are Celebration Milestones?

Automatic detection of achievements with motivational messages. Celebrates both big and small wins to maintain engagement and motivation.

### Milestone Types

**1. Streak Achievements:**
- ‚ú® **3 in a row:** "Nice streak! You're really getting the hang of this."
- ‚ö° **5 in a row:** "You're on fire! Keep this momentum going!"
- üî• **10 in a row:** "Unstoppable! This kind of consistency shows real mastery."

**2. Concept Completion:**
- üéâ **First concept:** "You've completed your first concept! This is a major milestone."
- ‚≠ê **Halfway** (4/7): "Halfway there! You're making excellent progress!"
- üèÜ **Course complete** (7/7): "AMAZING! You've mastered the fundamentals of Latin grammar!"

**3. Comeback Victory:**
- üí™ **Recovered from struggle:** "Incredible comeback! You struggled at first but didn't give up. This shows real growth mindset!"
  - Detected when: < 40% performance ‚Üí > 70% performance in recent window

### How It Works

**Detection Logic:**
```python
# Check consecutive correct answers
consecutive_correct = 0
for assessment in reversed(assessments):
    if assessment["score"] >= 1.0:
        consecutive_correct += 1
    else:
        break

if consecutive_correct >= 10:
    show_long_streak_message()
elif consecutive_correct >= 5:
    show_medium_streak_message()
elif consecutive_correct >= 3:
    show_short_streak_message()
```

**Comeback Detection:**
```python
# Split recent window into halves
first_half_score = calculate_avg(first_half)
second_half_score = calculate_avg(second_half)

# Comeback = struggled ‚Üí excelled
if first_half_score < 0.40 and second_half_score > 0.70:
    show_comeback_message()
```

### Implementation

**Backend Function (backend/app/tools.py:1190-1325):**
```python
celebration_info = detect_celebration_milestones(
    learner_id=learner_id,
    concept_id=concept_id,
    is_correct=is_correct,
    concept_completed=concept_completed,
    concepts_completed_total=concepts_completed_total
)

if celebration_info:
    celebration_message = celebration_info["celebration_message"]
    # Add to assessment result response
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "assessment-result",
  "celebration": "üéâ Congratulations! You've completed your first concept!",
  "celebration_type": "first_concept"
}
```

## Feature 6: Hint System (Phase 2)

### What is the Hint System?

Graduated hints available in practice mode only. Provides three levels of support without giving away the answer immediately.

### Hint Levels

**Level 1 - Gentle Hint:**
- Indirect nudge toward the concept
- Asks guiding questions
- Example: "What case ending do you see in 'puellae'? Think about possession..."

**Level 2 - Direct Hint:**
- More specific guidance
- Narrows to grammatical feature
- Example: "The -ae ending indicates the genitive case, which shows possession or relationship..."

**Level 3 - Show Answer:**
- Reveals correct answer
- Explains reasoning
- Example: "The correct answer is 'genitive' (Option 1). The -ae ending is the signature of the genitive singular in the first declension, showing possession like 'of the girl'..."

### How It Works

**Usage Flow:**
1. Learner enables **practice mode**
2. Learner gets stuck on question
3. Learner clicks **"Request Hint"**
4. System generates gentle hint
5. If still stuck, learner requests **direct hint**
6. If still stuck, learner can **show answer**

**API Endpoint:**
```http
POST /request-hint
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "learner_id": "test-learner",
  "concept_id": "concept-001",
  "hint_level": "gentle",  // "gentle", "direct", or "answer"
  "question_context": {
    "scenario": "You see an inscription...",
    "question": "What case is 'puellae'?",
    "options": ["nominative", "genitive", "dative", "accusative"],
    "correct_answer": 1
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "hint_level": "gentle",
  "hint_text": "Look at the ending of 'puellae'. What does the -ae tell you about its grammatical function?",
  "practice_mode": true
}
```

### Implementation

**Hint Generation (backend/app/content_generators.py:503-583):**
```python
def generate_hint_request(question_context, hint_level, concept_id):
    if hint_level == "gentle":
        return "Generate a gentle hint that points toward the concept WITHOUT revealing the answer..."
    elif hint_level == "direct":
        return "Generate a direct hint that narrows to the specific grammatical feature..."
    else:  # answer
        return "Show the correct answer with explanation..."
```

**Endpoint (backend/app/main.py:819-921):**
```python
@app.post("/request-hint")
async def request_hint(request: Request, body: dict):
    # Check practice mode enabled
    if not practice_mode and not HINTS_ENABLED_IN_GRADED:
        raise HTTPException(403, "Hints only in practice mode")

    # Generate hint using Claude
    hint_text = call_claude_api(hint_prompt)

    return {"hint_text": hint_text}
```

### Frontend Integration (To Be Implemented)

**UI Component:**
```jsx
{practiceMode && (
  <HintButton
    onRequestHint={(level) => requestHint(level)}
    hintsUsed={hintsUsed}
    maxHints={2}
  />
)}
```

## Questions?

**Q: Will this make the course too easy?**
A: No! The system still maintains standards:
- Normal performance ‚Üí 75% threshold (reasonable)
- High performance ‚Üí 85% threshold (challenging)
- Struggling learners get temporary 70% threshold for confidence building

**Q: Can learners abuse practice mode to skip learning?**
A: Practice mode is an option, not default. Learners still need graded mode to progress. It's a tool for exploration, not avoidance.

**Q: How do I adjust the thresholds?**
A: Edit `backend/app/constants.py`:
```python
DIFFICULTY_DOWN_THRESHOLD = 0.40  # Adjust this
MASTERY_THRESHOLD_NORMAL = 0.75   # Adjust this
```
