INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING
CS 1101 - Winter 2025
Department of Computer Science

COURSE OVERVIEW
This course introduces students to computer programming using the Python programming language. No prior programming experience is required. Students will learn fundamental programming concepts, problem-solving strategies, and practical coding skills applicable across many domains. The course emphasizes hands-on practice and incremental skill building.

COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Write well-structured Python programs using variables, data types, and operators
2. Apply control structures (conditionals and loops) to solve computational problems
3. Create and use functions to organize code and promote reusability
4. Implement object-oriented programming principles including classes and inheritance
5. Manipulate data using Python's built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
6. Read from and write to files while handling errors appropriately
7. Debug code systematically using testing and debugging strategies

WEEKLY SCHEDULE

Week 1: Python Basics and First Program
Introduction to programming, Python installation, IDLE environment, variables, basic data types (int, float, string), arithmetic operators, print statements, user input, first complete program.

Week 2: Making Decisions with Conditionals
Boolean expressions, comparison operators, if statements, if-else statements, elif chains, nested conditionals, logical operators (and, or, not), common patterns in conditional logic.

Week 3: Repetition with Loops
While loops, for loops, range function, loop control (break, continue), nested loops, loop patterns (counter, accumulator, sentinel), avoiding infinite loops.

Week 4: Functions - Building Reusable Code
Function definition and calling, parameters and arguments, return values, scope (local vs global), docstrings, function design principles, testing functions.

Week 5: Strings and Text Processing
String indexing and slicing, string methods, string formatting, multi-line strings, common string operations, text manipulation patterns, working with user input.

Week 6: Lists - Ordered Collections
List creation and indexing, list methods (append, insert, remove, sort), list slicing, iterating through lists, list comprehensions, 2D lists, common list algorithms.

Week 7: Dictionaries and Sets
Dictionary basics (key-value pairs), accessing and modifying dictionaries, dictionary methods, iterating through dictionaries, sets and set operations, choosing appropriate data structures.

Week 8: File Input/Output
Reading text files, writing to files, with statements and context managers, CSV file handling, JSON data, file paths, exception handling basics.

Week 9: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
Classes and objects, attributes and methods, __init__ method, instance vs class variables, encapsulation, basic OOP design.

Week 10: Inheritance and Advanced OOP
Inheritance basics, method overriding, super() function, multiple inheritance, polymorphism, composition vs inheritance, when to use OOP.

Week 11: Error Handling and Debugging
Try-except blocks, common exception types, raising exceptions, finally clause, debugging strategies, using print debugging, Python debugger basics.

Week 12: Libraries and Practical Applications
Importing modules, exploring standard library (math, random, datetime), installing third-party packages with pip, introduction to numpy and pandas, final project work.
