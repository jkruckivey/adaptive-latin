# Ivey Pitch Strategy: Adaptive Learning System

## Strategic Reframe

**Original Vision:** Build an adaptive Latin learning system
**Revised Vision:** Build a content-agnostic adaptive learning system (demonstrated with Latin, scalable to business education)

**Target Audience:** Degree Program Managers, Associate Dean, Dean

**Pitch Type:** "Here's a prototype, let's partner" - seeking resources, access, and institutional support

## Core Value Proposition (Frame 1)

**The Pitch:**
"AI handles foundational content delivery adaptively. Faculty are freed to do what they do best - facilitate case discussions, coach students, guide ethical reasoning, bridge theory to practice. Students arrive to class already competent in the mechanics, ready for higher-order thinking."

### Why This Works for Ivey

- Ivey is already famous for case-method teaching
- They already believe value is in discussion, not lecture
- But students still need foundations before they can engage meaningfully with cases
- **Current state:** Textbooks, lectures, pre-reads for foundations → boring, inefficient, one-size-fits-all
- **Future state:** Personalized, adaptive, built-in assessment, students arrive ready

## What Leadership Cares About

1. **Strategic positioning** - Is Ivey future-ready?
2. **Resource efficiency** - Faculty time, cost per student
3. **Student outcomes** - Learning gains, engagement, retention
4. **Competitive advantage** - What can we do that others can't?
5. **Scalability** - Does this work for 100 students? 10,000?
6. **Risk management** - What if this fails? What if we don't do it?

## Current System Strengths

What the Latin demo currently proves:
- ✅ Adaptive difficulty works
- ✅ Confidence tracking enables personalization
- ✅ Scaffolding and hints help struggling learners
- ✅ The AI tutor can teach complex, hierarchical content
- ✅ It's engaging enough to keep learners going

## Critical Gaps for Leadership Pitch

### 1. Business Content Example (CRITICAL)
**Need:** ONE business concept fully built to prove content-agnostic capability

**Options:**
- **NPV/Time Value of Money** (foundational, clear right/wrong)
- **Financial Ratio Analysis** (hierarchical like Latin declensions)
- **Porter's Five Forces** (framework application)
- **Break-even Analysis** (quantitative, scaffolded)

**Action:** Pick ONE, build it quickly, show it works with different content

### 2. Integration with Case Method
Narrative: "Students complete adaptive module on financial ratios, then come to class for the XYZ case discussion already fluent in the mechanics."

### 3. Faculty Dashboard
Instructors need visibility:
- Who's struggling? Who's ready?
- What misconceptions are common?
- Data layer that empowers faculty to target interventions

### 4. Learning Analytics for Administrators
The business case requires:
- Time saved
- Cost per learner
- Completion rates
- Learning gains
- ROI metrics

### 5. The "What Faculty Get to Do Instead" Story
Concrete examples:
- More case discussions?
- More 1-on-1 coaching?
- More research?
- Deeper ethical reasoning exercises?

## Pitch Structure (15-20 minutes)

### 1. The Demo (15 minutes max)
- Show the Latin system working
- Narrate: "This is declensions, but imagine it's break-even analysis"
- Show: adaptive difficulty, confidence tracking, personalized scaffolding
- Emphasize: "I built this alone in [X weeks]. Imagine with resources."

### 2. The Business Case (1 slide)

| Current State | Future State |
|--------------|--------------|
| Faculty lecture on foundations | AI delivers foundations adaptively |
| One-size-fits-all problem sets | Personalized practice until mastery |
| Faculty grade mechanics | Automated assessment with rich feedback |
| Class time reviewing basics | Class time entirely case-discussion |
| Students arrive unprepared | Students arrive competent |

### 3. The Ask (Be Specific)

**To pilot this at Ivey, I need:**

#### Resources:
- [X hours/week] protected time for development
- Access to 2-3 faculty SMEs for content authoring
- [Budget] for technical infrastructure (hosting, AI API costs)
- 1 pilot course in [term/year]

#### Partnership:
- Executive sponsor (Associate Dean level)
- Pilot course coordinator
- 50-100 volunteer students for beta testing
- EdTech Lab support for evaluation

#### Deliverable:
- Fully functional adaptive system for [1 Ivey course]
- Learning analytics dashboard for faculty
- Pilot results and ROI analysis
- Roadmap for scaling across programs

### 4. The Timeline

- **Month 1-2:** Build business content module, faculty co-design
- **Month 3:** Beta test with small cohort
- **Month 4:** Refine based on feedback
- **Month 5:** Pilot with full course section
- **Month 6:** Evaluation, ROI analysis, scale plan

### 5. The Vision (Close Strong)

"Erin talked about radically inclusive, engaging learning environments where faculty aren't delivering content. Mark talked about returning to humanistic education, citizenship, asking 'what will I do with my life?'

This system makes that possible. AI handles the mechanics. Faculty become mentors, coaches, guides for life questions. Ivey becomes the business school that figured out how to use AI to become MORE human, not less.

The universities that survive won't be the ones with the best AI. They'll be the ones who figured out what humans should do when AI can do everything else.

That's the future. Let's build it."

## Pitch Narrative Template

```
"I built this adaptive learning system to prove AI can handle foundational
content delivery - the mechanics, the practice, the assessment. I used Latin
grammar because it's complex, hierarchical, and has clear right/wrong answers -
just like financial analysis or strategy frameworks.

This isn't about replacing faculty. It's about freeing them to do what we do
best at Ivey: case method teaching, coaching, mentorship, developing leaders.

Right now, faculty time goes to: teaching NPV calculations, explaining Porter's
Five Forces, grading problem sets. What if that happened adaptively, before
class? Students arrive competent in the mechanics, ready for higher-order
thinking.

I need: [clear ask]. In return: [clear deliverable].

This is the future. The question is whether Ivey leads or follows."
```

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. **Pick business content concept** - Which one resonates most with target audience?
2. **Build business content proof** - Full concept with adaptive mechanics
3. **Refine pitch deck** - 5-7 slides maximum
4. **Mock pitch practice** - Test narrative, timing, demo flow
5. **Identify champion** - Who internally can advocate?

## Key Insights from Strategic Conversation

### Erin's Vision
"Her hope for the future is an attention to small, engaging learning environments but much more radically inclusive. Faculty less about delivery of content - adaptive AI can deliver the content."

### Mark's Vision
"It will look like something from the past. More like of the past with a focus on the humanities. Questions now are: what am I going to do with my life? AI can do accounting. The university now becomes a place about humanistic research. Young people can come here to grow into citizens. We got caught up in job readiness."

### The Synthesis
This system enables both visions: AI handles the "job readiness" mechanics, freeing faculty and students for humanistic growth, citizenship, deeper questions.
