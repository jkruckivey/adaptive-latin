# Supply and Demand Fundamentals

## What is Demand?

**Demand** represents the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a specific time period.

### The Law of Demand

The law of demand states: **As price increases, quantity demanded decreases** (and vice versa), assuming all other factors remain constant (ceteris paribus).

**Why?**
- **Substitution effect**: When prices rise, consumers substitute cheaper alternatives
- **Income effect**: Higher prices reduce purchasing power, limiting consumption

### Demand Curve

The demand curve is typically **downward sloping** from left to right:
- X-axis: Quantity demanded
- Y-axis: Price
- Each point represents price-quantity combinations consumers will accept

### Factors That Shift Demand

The demand curve shifts when factors other than price change:

**Increase Demand (shift right)**:
- Consumer income rises (for normal goods)
- Price of substitutes increases
- Price of complements decreases
- Consumer preferences favor the good
- Population increases
- Expectations of future price increases

**Decrease Demand (shift left)**:
- Consumer income falls (for normal goods)
- Price of substitutes decreases
- Price of complements increases
- Consumer preferences shift away
- Population decreases
- Expectations of future price decreases

## What is Supply?

**Supply** represents the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to offer at various prices during a specific time period.

### The Law of Supply

The law of supply states: **As price increases, quantity supplied increases** (and vice versa), assuming all other factors remain constant.

**Why?**
- Higher prices make production more profitable
- Producers are incentivized to allocate more resources to that good
- More firms enter the market when prices rise

### Supply Curve

The supply curve is typically **upward sloping** from left to right:
- X-axis: Quantity supplied
- Y-axis: Price
- Each point represents price-quantity combinations producers will accept

### Factors That Shift Supply

The supply curve shifts when factors other than price change:

**Increase Supply (shift right)**:
- Input costs decrease (labor, materials, energy)
- Technology improves production efficiency
- Number of sellers increases
- Favorable weather (for agricultural goods)
- Expectations of future price decreases
- Government subsidies

**Decrease Supply (shift left)**:
- Input costs increase
- Technology deteriorates or becomes obsolete
- Number of sellers decreases
- Unfavorable weather
- Expectations of future price increases
- Government taxes or regulations

## Key Terminology

- **Quantity Demanded**: Specific amount consumers will buy at a specific price
- **Change in Quantity Demanded**: Movement along the demand curve (due to price change)
- **Change in Demand**: Shift of the entire demand curve (due to non-price factors)
- **Quantity Supplied**: Specific amount producers will offer at a specific price
- **Change in Quantity Supplied**: Movement along the supply curve (due to price change)
- **Change in Supply**: Shift of the entire supply curve (due to non-price factors)

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Confusing movement along the curve with shifts of the curve**
- Price changes cause *movement along* the curve
- Non-price factors cause *shifts* of the entire curve

❌ **Mixing up supply and demand**
- Demand = consumer behavior
- Supply = producer behavior

❌ **Forgetting ceteris paribus**
- Laws of supply and demand assume "all else equal"
- In reality, multiple factors change simultaneously
