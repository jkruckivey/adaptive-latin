  - Leverages your expertise in Latin & Latin literature
  - Natural mastery-based progression (concepts build sequentially)
  - Clear assessment criteria (right/wrong answers for validation)
  - Underserved domain (classical languages need better ed-tech)

### 3. Course Structure

  - Concept 001: First Declension + Sum, esse ✓ COMPLETE
  - Concept 002: First Conjugation Verbs (present system)
  - Concept 003: Second Declension Nouns (M/N)
  - Concept 004: Adjectives (1st/2nd Decl) + Agreement
  - Concept 005: Perfect System
  - Concept 006: Third Declension Nouns
  - Concept 007: Infinitives + Indirect Statement (capstone)

### 4. Concept 001 - Fully Authored ✓
**Location**: `resource-bank/latin-grammar/concept-001/`

**Teaching Resources**:
- [x] `metadata.json` - Learning objectives, vocabulary (10 nouns + sum)
- [x] `text-explainer.md` - 1800-word teaching resource
  - Complete paradigm tables
  - Case functions explained
  - Sum conjugation
  - Common mistakes
  - Quick reference charts

- [x] `examples.json` - 7 worked examples
  - Complete paradigm demonstration
  - Case identification in context
  - Common mistakes and corrections
  - Practice drills
  - Sentence construction patterns

**Assessments**:
- [x] `dialogue-prompts.json` - 6 Socratic questions
  - Basic: Form identification
  - Intermediate: Ambiguity resolution, case function explanation
  - Advanced: Syntax reasoning, word order flexibility
  - Each with detailed rubrics (excellent/good/developing/insufficient)

- [x] `written-prompts.json` - 2 analytical writing tasks
  - Explain case system to beginners (150-250 words)
  - Translate + grammatical commentary on 3 sentences
  - Multi-dimensional rubrics

- [x] `applied-tasks.json` - 3 practical exercises
  - Translation (5 sentences)
  - Form identification (including ambiguous cases)
  - Form production (generate 8 forms on demand)
  - Detailed scoring rubrics with common errors noted

**Quality Features**:
- Tests ambiguous forms (puellae = 3 possible cases - requires context)
- Syntax-based reasoning (endings show function, not word order)
- Production vs. recognition balance
- Latin-specific rubrics that capture true understanding

## Next Steps (Your Choice)

### Option A: Continue Authoring Content (Recommended)
**Goal**: Complete all 7 concepts before building technical infrastructure

**Tasks**:
1. Author Concept 002: First Conjugation Verbs (6-8 hours)
2. Author Concept 003: Second Declension Nouns (6-8 hours)
3. Author Concept 004: Adjectives + Agreement (6-8 hours)
4. Author Concept 005: Perfect System (8-10 hours)
5. Author Concept 006: Third Declension Nouns (8-10 hours)
6. Author Concept 007: Infinitives + Indirect Statement (10-12 hours)

**Total Authoring Time**: 44-56 hours

**Why this order**:
- Content is the foundation - technical infrastructure is useless without it
- You can test each concept independently before moving to next
- Once all content is ready, technical build can proceed uninterrupted

### Option B: Build Minimal Backend + Test Concept 001
**Goal**: Validate the AI agent can actually conduct assessments with Concept 001

**Tasks**:
1. Set up Python environment + Anthropic API (2-3 hours)
2. Implement resource loading tools (4-6 hours)
3. Implement AI agent with tool use (8-10 hours)
4. Test agent conducting dialogue assessment on Concept 001 (2-3 hours)
5. Refine rubrics based on agent behavior (2-4 hours)

**Total Time**: 18-26 hours

**Why this order**:
- Validates core assumption: AI can assess Latin understanding
- Allows refinement of assessment rubrics before authoring 6 more concepts
- De-risks the project early
- May reveal needed changes to assessment approach

### Option C: Pause for Review
**Goal**: Review Concept 001 materials before proceeding

**You might want to**:
- Read through the text-explainer to ensure tone/level is right
- Review assessment questions for difficulty appropriateness
- Check rubrics for clarity and accuracy
- Consider whether example/assessment balance is correct

## Metrics

### Content Authored
- **Concepts Complete**: 1 / 7 (14%)
- **Files Created**: 6
- **Total Content**: ~3500 lines (teaching resources, examples, assessments)
- **Estimated Work Hours**: 8-10 hours

### Content Remaining
- **Concepts to Author**: 6
- **Estimated Hours**: 44-56 hours
- **Average per Concept**: 6-10 hours (Concept 001 established the template, so subsequent concepts should be faster)

### Technical Implementation
- **Phase 1** (Foundation): Not started
- **Phase 2** (Backend): Not started
- **Phase 3** (Frontend): Not started
- **Phase 4** (Testing): Not started

## Project Timeline Estimate

### If continuing with authoring (Option A):
- **Week 1-2**: Concepts 002-003 (12-16 hours)
- **Week 3-4**: Concepts 004-005 (14-18 hours)
- **Week 5-6**: Concepts 006-007 (18-22 hours)
- **Week 7**: Buffer for refinements (4-8 hours)
- **Week 8-10**: Technical implementation (backend + frontend)
- **Week 11**: Testing with pilot learner
- **Total**: ~11 weeks to working PoC

### If building backend first (Option B):
- **Week 1-2**: Backend + test Concept 001 (18-26 hours)
- **Week 3**: Refine based on testing (4-8 hours)
- **Week 4-6**: Author Concepts 002-004 (18-24 hours)
- **Week 7-9**: Author Concepts 005-007 (26-32 hours)
- **Week 10**: Frontend + integration (10-15 hours)
- **Week 11**: Testing with pilot learner
- **Total**: ~11 weeks to working PoC

Both paths take similar time, but **Option A** de-risks content quality, while **Option B** de-risks technical feasibility.

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Authoring takes longer than expected
**Status**: Low risk - Concept 001 template is established
**Mitigation**: Subsequent concepts follow same structure, should be faster

### Risk: AI agent can't reliably assess Latin
**Status**: Medium risk - untested assumption
**Mitigation**: Option B (build backend early) would test this

### Risk: Assessment rubrics need significant refinement
**Status**: Medium risk - won't know until agent testing
**Mitigation**: Either test early (Option B) or plan for iteration after authoring

### Risk: Content is too easy/too hard for target learners
**Status**: Low risk - your Latin expertise mitigates this
**Mitigation**: Pilot testing with 1-2 learners will reveal

---

## Recommendation

**Recommended Path**: **Option A** (Complete all authoring, then build)

**Rationale**:
1. Content is the harder, more time-intensive part
2. Your Latin expertise is the unique value - leverage it now
3. Technical implementation is more predictable (follow roadmap)
4. Having all 7 concepts allows better backend optimization
5. Can pivot technical approach if needed without losing content work

**Alternative**: If you want early validation that AI can assess Latin, do **Option B** (build backend with Concept 001 only), then return to authoring Concepts 002-007 with confidence the system works.

---

## Questions to Consider

1. **Authoring pace**: Can you commit 6-10 hours per concept over next 6-8 weeks?
2. **Technical skills**: Are you comfortable with Python + APIs, or will you need assistance?
3. **Testing access**: Do you have 1-2 willing pilot learners (Latin students) for final testing?
4. **Risk tolerance**: Would you prefer to de-risk technical assumptions early (Option B) or focus on content quality (Option A)?

## What's Working Well

✓ Domain choice (Latin) aligns perfectly with system design
✓ Concept 001 has excellent pedagogical depth
✓ Assessment types (dialogue/written/applied) test different dimensions
✓ Rubrics are specific and actionable for AI evaluation
✓ Framework is proven adaptable (started with econ examples, pivoted to Latin seamlessly)
