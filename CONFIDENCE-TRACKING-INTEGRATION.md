# Confidence Tracking Integration - Complete Summary

**Status**: ✅ Fully Integrated into System
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-21
**Approach**: Hybrid (Post-Assessment + Concept-Level + Visual Journey)

---

## What Was Integrated

### 1. Comprehensive Design Document ✓
**File**: `CONFIDENCE-TRACKING.md`

Contains:
- 5 implementation options analyzed
- Pedagogical rationale (metacognition, Dunning-Kruger, calibration theory)
- Recommended hybrid approach
- Research basis and data analysis possibilities
- UI mockups for visual confidence journey

### 2. Updated Learner Model Schema ✓
**File**: `examples/learner-models/learner-002-latin-with-confidence.json`

New fields added:
- `self_reported_confidence` (1-5 rating)
- `confidence_calibration` (overall assessment)
- `confidence_history` (detailed per-assessment tracking)
- `calibration_trends` (improving, stable, degrading)
- `calibration_metrics` (accuracy, over/under-confidence rates)

**Example Data Captured**:
```json
{
  "assessment_id": "dialogue-001-4",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-24T14:00:00Z",
  "self_confidence": 2,
  "actual_score": 0.95,
  "calibration": "significantly_underconfident",
  "error": -3,
  "feedback": "You gave an EXCELLENT answer but rated only 2/5 confidence..."
}
```

### 3. Assessment Files Updated ✓
**Files Modified**:
- `dialogue-prompts.json`
- `written-prompts.json`
- `applied-tasks.json`

**Added to Each**:
- `confidence_tracking_enabled: true`
- `confidence_prompt` with 1-5 scale and descriptions
- Instructions for when to ask (after response, before feedback)

**Example**:
```json
{
  "confidence_prompt": "Before I give you feedback, how confident are you in this answer? (1-5)\n  1 - Just guessing\n  2 - Not very confident\n  3 - Somewhat confident\n  4 - Quite confident\n  5 - Very confident"
}
```

### 4. Python Code Implementation ✓
**File**: `examples/backend/confidence_tracking.py`

Functions implemented:
- `map_score_to_confidence(score)` - Convert 0-1 score to 1-5 expected confidence
- `calculate_calibration(self_confidence, actual_score)` - Calculate error and categorize
- `get_calibration_feedback(calibration_data)` - Generate student-facing feedback
- `calculate_overall_calibration(history)` - Aggregate metrics over time
- `detect_calibration_trend(history)` - Is calibration improving/stable/degrading?
- `should_intervene_on_confidence(...)` - Decision support for AI agent

**Example Usage**:
```python
calibration = calculate_calibration(self_confidence=2, actual_score=0.95)
# Returns: {
#   "calibration": "significantly_underconfident",
#   "error": -3,
#   "feedback": "You're doing better than you think!"
# }
```

### 5. AI Agent Response Protocols ✓
**File**: `examples/prompts/confidence-response-addendum.md`

Detailed templates for:
- **Well-calibrated responses**: Celebrate self-awareness
- **Overconfident responses** (slight/moderate/severe): Address gaps non-judgmentally
- **Underconfident responses** (slight/moderate/severe): Encourage and build confidence
- **Special situations**: Persistent patterns, calibration improvements, wild swings
- **Progression decisions**: How confidence affects progress/continue/regress

**Example Template (Severely Underconfident)**:
```
"Wait - you rated 1/5 confidence ('just guessing'), but your answer scored 0.95.
That's nearly perfect! [Investigate reasoning] See? You weren't guessing - you
were applying the paradigm correctly. Give yourself more credit!"
```

## How It Works (User Flow)

### Step 1: Student Completes Assessment
```
AI: "What case is 'puellae' in 'Aquam puellae do'?"
Student: "I think dative? Because you give TO someone?"
```

### Step 2: AI Requests Confidence Rating
```
AI: "Before I give you feedback, how confident are you? (1-5)"
Student: [selects 2 - "Not very confident"]
```

### Step 3: AI Evaluates Response
```
[Internal] AI scores response: 0.95 (excellent reasoning)
[Internal] AI calculates calibration:
  - self_confidence: 2
  - actual_score: 0.95
  - expected_confidence: 5
  - error: -3 (significantly underconfident)
```

### Step 4: AI Provides Calibration-Aware Feedback
```
AI: "You're absolutely right! Puellae is dative - 'to the girl.' Your reasoning
     from the verb 'do' (I give) to 'gives TO someone' was perfect.

     I noticed you rated your confidence as 2/5, but this answer was excellent
     (scored 0.95). You have stronger understanding than you realize. What made
     you feel uncertain?"

Student: "I saw -ae and wasn't sure if it was dative or genitive."

AI: "That shows sophisticated awareness of the ambiguity! But your logic from
     the verb to the case was spot-on. Trust that reasoning more. You're
     developing good instincts!"
```

### Step 5: Data Logged to Learner Model
```json
{
  "id": "dialogue-001-2",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T10:30:00Z",
  "score": 0.95,
  "self_confidence": 2,
  "calibration": "significantly_underconfident",
  "calibration_error": -3,
  "feedback": "..."
}
```

### Step 6: Concept-Level Confidence Check (At Transition)
```
[After mastering Concept 001]

AI: "Excellent! You've demonstrated mastery of first declension (0.88 confidence).

     Before moving to first conjugation verbs, how confident do you feel with
     first declension overall? (1-5)

     (Optional) Anything still unclear?"

Student: [rates 4] "Pretty confident, though sometimes I mix up puellae cases"

AI: "Your self-assessment (4/5) aligns well with your mastery (0.88). That's
     great calibration! The puellae ambiguity takes practice - you'll get more
     context clues as sentences get more complex. Ready for verbs?"
```

### Step 7: Visual Journey (Future Phase)
```
Dashboard shows:
- Graph: Confidence vs Performance over time
- Trend: "Calibration improving! Started overconfident, now well-calibrated"
- Recent assessments with calibration status
- Metacognitive growth indicators
```

## Integration Points in System Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + Python)

**New Tool for AI Agent**:
```python
def track_confidence(learner_id: str, assessment_id: str,
                    self_confidence: int, actual_score: float) -> dict:
    """Calculate calibration and update learner model."""
    calibration = calculate_calibration(self_confidence, actual_score)
    update_learner_model(learner_id, assessment_id, calibration)
    return calibration
```

**Tool Definitions for Claude API**:
```json
{
  "name": "track_confidence",
  "description": "Track student confidence rating and calculate calibration",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "learner_id": {"type": "string"},
      "assessment_id": {"type": "string"},
      "self_confidence": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 5},
      "actual_score": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1}
    }
  }
}
```

### Frontend (Chat UI)

**New UI Element**: Confidence Rating Buttons
```html
<div class="confidence-rating">
  <p>How confident are you in your answer?</p>
  <button data-confidence="1">1 - Just guessing</button>
  <button data-confidence="2">2 - Not very confident</button>
  <button data-confidence="3">3 - Somewhat confident</button>
  <button data-confidence="4">4 - Quite confident</button>
  <button data-confidence="5">5 - Very confident</button>
</div>
```

**Future Phase**: Confidence Journey Dashboard
- Line graph: Confidence vs Performance
- Calibration accuracy metric
- Recent assessments list with calibration status

### AI Agent Prompt

**Add to system prompt**:
```
## Confidence Tracking

After each assessment:
1. Ask learner to rate confidence (1-5)
2. Evaluate response and calculate score
3. Use track_confidence() tool to calculate calibration
4. Provide feedback that acknowledges calibration:
   - Calibrated: Celebrate self-awareness
   - Overconfident: Identify gap, non-judgmentally
   - Underconfident: Encourage, build justified confidence

[See confidence-response-addendum.md for detailed templates]
```

## Benefits Realized

### For Learners

**Metacognitive Development**:
- Learn to accurately assess their own understanding
- Develop "knowing what they know" skill
- Build healthier relationship with uncertainty

**Personalized Support**:
- Overconfident learners get gap-focused intervention
- Underconfident learners get encouragement and confidence-building
- Well-calibrated learners get affirmed and progressed

**Visible Progress**:
- See calibration accuracy improve over time
- Celebrate metacognitive growth, not just content mastery

### For AI Agent

**Better Decision-Making**:
- Confidence + Performance = richer picture than performance alone
- Can distinguish "struggling but aware" from "struggling and unaware"
- Can identify when learner is ready despite self-doubt

**Targeted Interventions**:
- **High confidence + Low score** → Address misconception
- **Low confidence + High score** → Build confidence
- **Low confidence + Low score** → Extra support or regression
- **High confidence + High score** → Progress

**Early Warning System**:
- Sudden confidence drops → Possible frustration, fatigue, or hitting complexity wall
- Persistent overconfidence → Dunning-Kruger, needs calibration training
- Wild swings → Searching for calibration (healthy development phase)

### For System Evaluation

**Research Data**:
- Does calibration improve over time? (Hypothesis: Yes)
- Which concepts produce overconfidence vs underconfidence?
- Does confidence correlate with time-to-mastery?
- Can confidence patterns predict who needs regression?

**System Refinement**:
- Identify where rubrics may be unclear (high confidence variability)
- Validate that AI feedback improves calibration
- A/B test different calibration feedback approaches

## Example: Complete Confidence-Aware Assessment Session

```
SESSION START

AI: "Let's test your understanding of first declension. What case is 'puellam'?"

Student: "Accusative - it's the direct object case."

AI: "How confident are you? (1-5)"

Student: [5]

AI: [Evaluates: Correct, score 1.0]
    [Calibration: self=5, expected=5, error=0 → calibrated]

    "Exactly right! Puellam is accusative, the direct object. And your confidence
     (5/5) perfectly matches your understanding - excellent self-awareness!"

---

AI: "Now, what about 'puellae' in 'Aquam puellae do'?"

Student: "I think... dative? Because you give TO someone?"

AI: "How confident?"

Student: [2]

AI: [Evaluates: Correct, excellent reasoning, score 0.95]
    [Calibration: self=2, expected=5, error=-3 → severely underconfident]

    "You're absolutely right! Your reasoning was perfect - 'do' means 'I give,'
     and you correctly identified that you give TO someone, so dative.

     I noticed you rated only 2/5 confidence, but this was an excellent answer
     (0.95). You have stronger understanding than you realize. What made you
     uncertain?"

Student: "Saw -ae and thought it could be genitive or nominative plural too."

AI: "That's actually sophisticated thinking - recognizing the ambiguity! But your
     logic from the verb was spot-on. Trust that reasoning more. You're developing
     good instincts."

---

AI: "Last one: Conjugate sum, esse in present tense. Just singular forms."

Student: "Sum, es, est"

AI: "Confidence?"

Student: [5]

AI: [Evaluates: Incomplete - only gave singular, not plural. Score 0.65]
    [Calibration: self=5, expected=3, error=+2 → moderately overconfident]

    "You gave the singular forms correctly! However, I asked for all present tense
     forms, including plural (sumus, estis, sunt). You only provided half.

     You rated 5/5 confidence, but the score was 3/5 level due to incompleteness.
     This happens - let's make sure you have the full conjugation down. Can you
     give me the plural forms?"

Student: "Oh! Sumus, estis, sunt."

AI: "Perfect! Now you have the complete set. This is a good reminder to check what
     the question is asking. Your calibration is developing - this kind of
     awareness helps you catch these things."

---

SESSION END

[Learner model updated with 3 confidence assessments]
[Calibration trend: 1 calibrated, 1 underconfident, 1 overconfident → "searching"]
[Overall confidence accuracy: 0.67 (improving from previous 0.50)]
```
