## Concept Progression

### Concept 001: First Declension Nouns + Sum, esse (present tense)
**Difficulty**: 1 (Foundation)
**Prerequisites**: None
**Estimated Time**: 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives**:
- Identify first declension nouns by their nominative singular ending (-a)
- Decline first declension nouns in all cases (singular and plural)
- Explain the function of each case (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative)
- Conjugate sum, esse in the present tense
- Translate simple sentences using first declension nouns and forms of sum

**Key Vocabulary**: puella (girl), via (road), porta (gate), vita (life), terra (land)

**Common Misconceptions**:
- Confusing ablative and dative (both -ae in singular)
- Thinking -ae is always plural (it's also genitive/dative singular)
- Not recognizing that case endings show function, not position in sentence

---

### Concept 002: First Conjugation Verbs (Present System)
**Difficulty**: 2
**Prerequisites**: Concept 001
**Estimated Time**: 75-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives**:
- Identify first conjugation verbs by their infinitive ending (-are)
- Conjugate first conjugation verbs in present, imperfect, and future tenses
- Explain personal endings (-o, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt)
- Distinguish between present, imperfect, and future time
- Translate sentences with first conjugation verbs and first declension nouns

**Key Vocabulary**: amare (to love), vocare (to call), portare (to carry), laborare (to work), narrare (to tell)

**Common Misconceptions**:
- Confusing present and future in third person plural (amant vs. amabunt)
- Not recognizing the -ba- marker for imperfect
- Thinking -re is a personal ending (it's infinitive marker)

---

### Concept 003: Second Declension Nouns (Masculine & Neuter)
**Difficulty**: 2
**Prerequisites**: Concepts 001-002
**Estimated Time**: 75-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives**:
- Identify second declension masculine nouns (-us, -er) and neuter nouns (-um)
- Decline second declension nouns in all cases
- Explain the neuter rule (nominative = accusative)
- Translate sentences with mixed first and second declension nouns
- Identify grammatical gender vs. natural gender

**Key Vocabulary**:
- Masculine: amicus (friend), filius (son), ager (field), puer (boy)
- Neuter: bellum (war), donum (gift), verbum (word)

**Common Misconceptions**:
- Assuming all -us nouns are masculine (some are feminine/neuter)
- Forgetting that neuter plural nominative/accusative ends in -a
- Not dropping the -e- in words like ager → agri

---

### Concept 004: Adjectives (1st/2nd Declension) + Agreement
**Difficulty**: 3
**Prerequisites**: Concepts 001-003
**Estimated Time**: 90-120 minutes

**Learning Objectives**:
- Decline adjectives using first declension (feminine) and second declension (masculine/neuter) endings
- Apply the agreement rule (adjective matches noun in gender, number, case - NOT ending)
- Distinguish between attributive and predicate adjectives
- Translate sentences with adjectives modifying nouns
- Explain why bonus -a -um has three different forms

**Key Vocabulary**: bonus (good), magnus (large), parvus (small), multus (much/many), meus (my)

**Common Misconceptions**:
- Thinking adjectives must have the same ending as their nouns
- Confusing gender agreement with declension pattern
- Not recognizing that word order is flexible (adjective can precede or follow noun)

---

### Concept 005: Perfect System (All Conjugations)
**Difficulty**: 4
**Prerequisites**: Concepts 001-004
**Estimated Time**: 90-120 minutes

**Learning Objectives**:
- Identify perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect tenses
- Explain the difference between present system (uses present stem) and perfect system (uses perfect stem)
- Form perfect active forms using perfect stem + endings (-i, -isti, -it, -imus, -istis, -erunt)
- Distinguish meanings: amavi (I loved/have loved), amaveram (I had loved), amavero (I will have loved)
- Translate sentences using perfect system tenses

**Key Vocabulary**: Perfect stems for common verbs (amav-, vocav-, portav-, lab-, narrav-)

**Common Misconceptions**:
- Confusing perfect and pluperfect (amavi vs. amaveram)
- Not recognizing that perfect tense has two English translations (I loved / I have loved)
- Thinking -erunt is future (it's perfect)

---

### Concept 006: Third Declension Nouns (Consonant Stems)
**Difficulty**: 4
**Prerequisites**: Concepts 001-005
**Estimated Time**: 90-120 minutes

**Learning Objectives**:
- Identify third declension nouns by their genitive singular ending (-is)
- Find the stem by dropping -is from genitive singular
- Decline third declension consonant-stem nouns (masculine, feminine, neuter)
- Distinguish between nominative and accusative in neuter third declension
- Translate sentences with all three declensions mixed

**Key Vocabulary**:
- Masculine: rex, regis (king); miles, militis (soldier); pater, patris (father)
- Feminine: mater, matris (mother); virtus, virtutis (virtue); pax, pacis (peace)
- Neuter: nomen, nominis (name); corpus, corporis (body); tempus, temporis (time)

**Common Misconceptions**:
- Trying to predict nominative from genitive (can't - must memorize both)
- Confusing third declension -is (genitive singular) with second declension -is (rare)
- Not recognizing gender from the dictionary entry

---

### Concept 007: Infinitives + Indirect Statement (Accusative + Infinitive)
**Difficulty**: 5 (Capstone)
**Prerequisites**: Concepts 001-006
**Estimated Time**: 120-150 minutes

**Learning Objectives**:
- Form present, perfect, and future infinitives (active and passive)
- Identify verbs of head, heart, and speech that take indirect statement
- Explain accusative + infinitive construction (subject accusative + infinitive)
- Distinguish between direct and indirect statement
- Translate complex sentences with embedded indirect statements

**Key Vocabulary**: Verbs of saying (dico, narro), thinking (puto, credo), perceiving (video, audio, sentio)

**Common Misconceptions**:
- Translating accusative as direct object instead of subject of infinitive
- Confusing indirect statement with indirect command
- Not recognizing that tense of infinitive is relative to main verb
- Thinking "that" must appear in Latin (it doesn't - construction shows it)

**Example**:
- Direct: "Puella bona est" (The girl is good)
- Indirect: "Dico puellam bonam esse" (I say that the girl is good)
  - puellam = accusative subject of infinitive
  - bonam = adjective agreeing with puellam
  - esse = infinitive

## Regression Scenarios

The AI agent might regress a learner in these situations:

### Scenario 1: Struggling with Concept 004 (Adjectives)
**Symptom**: Can't match adjective gender to noun gender
**Diagnosis**: Doesn't fully understand grammatical gender from Concepts 001-003
**Action**: Regress to Concept 003, review masculine/feminine/neuter distinction

### Scenario 2: Struggling with Concept 005 (Perfect System)
**Symptom**: Confuses perfect and imperfect tenses
**Diagnosis**: Never fully mastered present system tense formation
**Action**: Regress to Concept 002, strengthen understanding of tense markers

### Scenario 3: Struggling with Concept 007 (Indirect Statement)
**Symptom**: Translates accusative as direct object instead of subject of infinitive
**Diagnosis**: Weak understanding of case functions
**Action**: Regress to Concept 001, review case usage (especially accusative function)

### Scenario 4: Struggling with Concept 006 (3rd Declension)
**Symptom**: Can't identify stems or apply endings correctly
**Diagnosis**: Doesn't understand declension paradigm concept
**Action**: Regress to Concept 001 or 003, strengthen paradigm understanding

## Assessment Design Principles for Latin

### What Makes a Good Dialogue Assessment
- Start with "why" questions: "Why is this word ablative?"
- Ask for explanations: "How do you know this is third declension?"
- Test edge cases: "What if the noun were neuter instead of masculine?"
- Socratic progression: Basic identification → explanation → application

### What Makes a Good Written Assessment
- Analysis tasks: "Explain the grammatical structure of this sentence"
- Translation + commentary: "Translate and explain each case usage"
- Compare/contrast: "How does Latin express X differently than English?"

### What Makes a Good Applied Assessment
- Unseen translation passages (appropriate level)
- Parsing exercises: "Identify case, number, gender of each noun"
- Form production: "Give the genitive plural of X"
- Error correction: "Find and fix the mistakes in these Latin sentences"

### Self-Assessment Validation
**Student claims**: "I understand ablative case"
**AI validates with**:
- "Give me three different uses of the ablative"
- "Translate this sentence with an ablative of means"
- "How would you express 'with the soldiers' in Latin?"

If student can't do these → self-assessment accuracy is low → adjust trust level
